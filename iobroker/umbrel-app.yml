     💡 Want automation? Want custom dashboards? Want privacy-first logic without cloud lock-in? You've found your home base. ioBroker runs **entirely local** on your Umbrel node. Your data stays yours — 100%.

     --- 🔧 **Features at a glance:**

     - 🌐 Sleek web UI to configure devices and automations
     - 🧩 400+ adapters and integrations from the ioBroker community
     - 🛜 Local-first architecture (no vendor cloud required)
     - 🔐 Full control of your data, locally encrypted
     - 🧱 Visual logic editor (Blockly/JavaScript-based flows)

     --- 🚀 **Setup instructions:**

     - Open the dashboard at port `8097`
