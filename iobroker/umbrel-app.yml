     💡 Want automation? Want custom dashboards? Want privacy-first logic without cloud lock-in? You've found your home base. ioBroker runs **entirely local** on your Umbrel node. Your data stays yours — 100%.

     - 🔧 **Features at a glance**
       - 🌐 Sleek web UI to configure devices and automations
       - 🧩 400+ adapters and integrations from the ioBroker community
       - 🛜 Local-first architecture (no vendor cloud required)
       - 🔐 Full control of your data, locally encrypted
       - 🧱 Visual logic editor (Blockly/JavaScript-based flows)

     - 🚀 **Setup instructions**
       - Open the dashboard at port `8098`
       - On first launch, follow the **setup wizard**
       - USB devices (Zigbee, etc.) may require manual mapping in Docker
       - Use the Adapter tab to explore and install integrations

     For power users: install VIS, Node-RED, BackItUp, Alexa support and more — all through the integrated adapter system.
