  DATUM (Decentralized Alternative Templates for Universal Mining) is a brand new bitcoin mining protocol that allows you to create your own block templates using your own Bitcoin node.
  
  
  With DATUM on Umbrel, you gain full control over your Bitcoin mining setup, allowing you to use your own Bitcoin node to generate custom block templates and directly issue work to your miners.
  DATUM enables you to either solo mine or participate in pool mining while optimizing block creation without relying on third-party servers.
  
  
  Over the years, mining has drifted toward centralization, with large pools dominating the process and reducing miners to mere sellers of hash power.
  DATUM seeks to bring back the core principle of Bitcoin: decentralization, giving miners direct control over the block construction process once again.


  🛠️ SET-UP INSTRUCTIONS


  ### Bitcoin Node:
  
  
  Datum connects automatically to your Bitcoin Knots app upon installation. A full archival node is not required for mining, so you may wish to prune your node to save disk space. You can adjust this setting under Advanced Settings in the Bitcoin Knots app.
  

  ### Connecting Your Miner:
  

  Refer to your miner's documentation for specific setup details. Here's a general guide to connect your miner with Datum:

    - Stratum URL/Host/Pool: Use your umbrelOS device’s IP address (found in Settings on the umbrelOS home screen) and port 23334.
    e.g., stratum+tcp://192.168.4.56:23334

    - Username/Worker: Enter the Bitcoin address for receiving OCEAN rewards. Optionally, add a worker name after a period to identify your miner.
    e.g., bc1qabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz or bc1qabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.bitaxe

    - Password: Leave blank or enter any value if your miner requires a password.


  ### Advanced Configuration:
  
  
  Datum is pre-configured to work out-of-the-box on umbrelOS. For custom settings, edit the datum_gateway_config.json file. This option is for advanced users comfortable with the command line.
  
  1. From the umbrelOS homescreen, go to Settings > Advanced Settings > Terminal > umbrelOS to open a terminal.


  2. Edit the configuration file at /home/umbrel/umbrel/app-data/datum/data/settings/datum_gateway_config.json.


  3. Restart Datum from the umbrelOS homescreen by right-clicking the Datum app and selecting Restart.
