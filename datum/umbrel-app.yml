  DATUM (Decentralized Alternative Templates for Universal Mining) is a brand new bitcoin mining protocol that allows you to create your own block templates using your own Bitcoin node.
  
  
  With DATUM on Umbrel, you gain full control over your Bitcoin mining setup, allowing you to use your own Bitcoin node to generate custom block templates and directly issue work to your miners.
  DATUM enables you to either solo mine or participate in pool mining while optimizing block creation without relying on third-party servers.
  
  
  Over the years, mining has drifted toward centralization, with large pools dominating the process and reducing miners to mere sellers of hash power.
  DATUM seeks to bring back the core principle of Bitcoin: decentralization, giving miners direct control over the block construction process once again.
