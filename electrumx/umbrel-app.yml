releaseNotes: >
  Fixed an issue where port 50003 for Tor connections wasn't working, even though it's shown in the app instructions. 
  You can now connect using port 50003 as intended.


  If you're already connected over Tor using 50001, everything will continue working as before - no changes needed.
