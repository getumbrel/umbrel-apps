description: >-
  autobrr is the modern download automation tool for torrents and usenet.
  With inspiration and ideas from tools like trackarr, autodl-irssi and flexget we built one tool that can do it all, and then some.


  Many indexers announce new torrents on their IRC channels the second it is uploaded to the site.


  autobrr monitors such channels in real time and grabs the torrent file as soon as it's uploaded based on certain conditions that you set up within autobrr.


  It then sends that torrent file to a download client of your choice. A download client can be anything from qBittorrent, Deluge, Radarr, Sonarr, watch folder, and more.
