  Purpose built for real-time analytics at any scale.


  Powered by columnar analytics, optimized for cost-efficient storage, and built with open data standards.


  - Unmatched Performance at Scale: manage millions of time series data points per second without limits or caps.

  
  - Columnar Analytics: columnar datastore delivers faster analytic queries by orders of magnitude and reduces storage footprint.


  - High-Speed Ingest: ingest billions of series with fewer CPUs and less RAM at a fraction of the storage cost.


  - Real-Time Querying: sub-second query responses for recent and live incoming data.


  - Unlimited Cardinality: analyze billions of time series and data points per second without limitations or caps.


  - Low-Cost Object Store with Parquet: separation of compute from storage with best-in-category compression to store more data using less space.


  - Interoperability with Data Lakehouses: built on open data standards for direct access to data from lakehouses and warehouses via Apache Iceberg.
