description: >
  📝 Flatnotes is a clean, self-hosted note-taking app that treats your ideas with respect. Every note you write lives as a plain Markdown file in a simple folder on your own server. 
  No databases lurking in the background, no vendor lock-in, no complicated structure. You remain in full control of your thoughts and your data at all times.



  The interface keeps distractions out of the way so you can focus entirely on writing. Quickly create notes, add tags, and jump across your knowledge with powerful full-text search.
  Wikilinks make it effortless to connect ideas, turning your notes into a personal knowledge network. Switch between raw Markdown and a polished WYSIWYG editor whenever your mood shifts.



  Flatnotes stays lightweight yet capable. Everything syncs instantly, even if you edit files outside the app.
  Browse from any device with a responsive design that feels right whether you are at your desk or out in the world. 
  Theming keeps your space cozy with beautiful light and dark modes.



  Flatnotes frees your notes from proprietary cages and lets them breathe as future-proof Markdown. 
  It can serve as your personal journal, research companion, digital garden, or anything else your creativity grows into. Pure writing. Pure ownership. Zero noise.
