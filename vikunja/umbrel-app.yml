  Think of Vikunja like the notebook you have with all your things to keep track of. But with superpowers.


  🗂️ Stay Organized

  Organize all of your tasks in projects. Create subprojects organize everything hierarchical and keep related stuff grouped together.


  👥 Collaborate With Peers

  Vikunja lets you easily share a project with another user or a whole team! Assignments show who's working on what.


  🛠️ Use It How You Need It

  You can view your tasks in the classic list view - or in a Gantt Chart, or Table view, or Kanban Board. Whatever you need!
releaseNotes: >-
  Welcome to Vikunja v0.24! There are many new features and improvements in this release. Some highlights include:
    - New Views Functionality: The new views system allows you to customize how you see your tasks in each project.
    - Improved Filters: You can now create more complex and precise filters using a simple query language.
    - Emoji Reactions: You can now react to tasks and comments with emojis, similar to many modern communication platforms.
    - Automatically create teams from openid claims: Automatically place users into the correct teams based on their roles or attributes in your organization's identity system, saving time on manual user management.
    - New UI languages: The Vikunja web UI is now available in Portuguese Brazilian, Croatian, and Ukrainian.
    - and much more!

  🚨 Breaking changes:

  
  Due to the way the views were changed, we had to do a few breaking changes:
    - Kanban buckets now belong to a project view instead of directly to a project.
    - New endpoint to change a task's position in a view. The position now depends on the context (the view) of the task. As a result, the position and kanban_position task attributes are no longer available.
    - New endpoint to move a task between buckets. Passing a bucket_id when updating the task will not have an effect anymore, you'll need to use the new dedicated endpoint for that.
    - If you shared a project via a link share and specified a view with the link, you'll need to update the link to point to the view.
