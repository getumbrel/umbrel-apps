  Think of Vikunja like the notebook you have with all your things to keep track of. But with superpowers.


  🗂️ Stay Organized

  Organize all of your tasks in projects. Create subprojects organize everything hierarchical and keep related stuff grouped together.


  👥 Collaborate With Peers

  Vikunja lets you easily share a project with another user or a whole team! Assignments show who's working on what.


  🛠️ Use It How You Need It

  You can view your tasks in the classic list view - or in a Gantt Chart, or Table view, or Kanban Board. Whatever you need!
