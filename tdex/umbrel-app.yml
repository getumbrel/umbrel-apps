tagline: Provide liquidity on the TDEX Network, an open protocol to trade Liquid Network assets
description: >-
  A liquidity provider holds Liquid reserves of both a BASE_ASSET-QUOTE_ASSET in his non-custodial Liquid hot-wallet,
  running automated market-making strategies, either with or without an oracle. Providers are incentivized to
  be always on and need to expose a public reachable endpoint either via clearnet or using an Onion hidden service.
  
  
  A small provider's fee can be taken out of each trade and added to the reserves. A liquidity provider has full control
  over the market making strategy needed to calculate the market rate at which to accept trades. That being said,
  there is a possibility to apply an automated market-making strategy relying only on the reserves balances and the amount requested
  by the trader, without the need to connect to an external price feed. The default strategy of the alpha daemond is the
  constant product market-making. In short, this model generates a full order-book based on an initial price for the market.
  Every transaction that occurs on this market will adjust the prices of the market accordingly.

  This update will require you to restore your wallet from the 24-word recovery phrase.


  This is a major update of the TDEX daemon that contains several changes, including:

  - Update to TDEXv2: the daemon's Trade interface implements the specs of the new TDEX v2 protocol. With this update the daemon makes
  use of PSETv2 as a way for describing and build transactions (instead of the old PSETv0), and, also, exposes some new endpoint according
  to the spec.
  
  - Wallet detachment: the daemon now requires a connection to an Ocean wallet that is fully responsible of deriving new key pairs
  and scan the chain for them. The wallet produces events consumed by the daemon for confirmed/unconfirmed txs and utxos.
  This drastically improves the overall perfomances of the service.
  You don't need to manually claim the funds deposited to the dameon anymore.

  - Embedded price feeder: the daemon allows you to set up price feeds for your pluggable-strategy markets to keep their price always up-to-date.
