releaseNotes: >
  Updates Uptime Kuma from version 1.19.6 to 1.21.2.
  

  🆕 New Features:
  
  - Now you can schedule maintenance with a cron expression + duration
   
   
  💇‍♀️ Improvements to Maintenance:

  - The core of maintenance feature is completely rewritten and is changed to cron based, the performance is much better

  - Effective Date Range is no longer required, it is now optional

  - Ability to set a timezone per maintenance

  - Ability to follow the timezone with DST

  
  🐛 Bug Fixes:
  
  - #3003 Maintenance is completely bugged in 1.21.1 and 1.21.0
  
  - #2988 Fix Ignore TLS/SSL Error is not working when using a proxy (Thanks @chakflying)
  
 
  ⚠️ IMPORTANT - After upgrading, you should review the following maintenance items:
  
  - All old maintenance schedules will be set to UTC individually, if you need other timezones, please change it individually.
  
  - Since previous versions' maintenance is always respected to UTC, which means the maintenance time could be shifted due to DST in your country. 
  
  - Breaking change: Due to the limitation of cron, the options Last 2nd day of month, 
  Last 3rd day of month and Last 4th day of month in the strategy Day of Month is no longer available. 
  (Last day of month is still available)
