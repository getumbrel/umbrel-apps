  LNbits is a lightweight accounting system for the Lightning Network.

  **Current (v1.4.2):** Connects via native Core Lightning JSON-RPC socket for stable channel management and payment accounting.

  **Future Ready:** Pre-configured for seamless migration to CLNRestWallet when Core Lightning v26 async architecture is deployed. This enables high-frequency micropayments, ZAP subscriptions, and real-time Lightning API integrations.
