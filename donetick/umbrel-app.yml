  Donetick is an open-source task management application designed to streamline the organization of household chores and other recurring responsibilities. It provides a flexible system for assigning tasks to multiple users, using various selection strategies such as random allocation or assignment based on the fewest completed tasks. Tasks can be scheduled with customizable recurrence patterns, making it easy to manage both daily routines and less frequent responsibilities.


  The platform offers real-time progress tracking and integrates with external notification services like Telegram and Pushover, ensuring that users stay informed about upcoming or overdue tasks. Additionally, Donetick supports API integrations, allowing tasks to be triggered automatically from other systems.


  For authentication and user management, Donetick supports Single Sign-On (SSO) and OpenID Connect (OIDC), making it easy to integrate with existing identity providers. A unique feature of the platform is NFC tag support, enabling users to complete tasks simply by scanning a tag. Labels and task groups further enhance organization, allowing tasks to be categorized and shared efficiently among members.


  With its combination of automation, smart scheduling, and collaborative task sharing, Donetick provides a powerful and user-friendly solution for managing household and group responsibilities.

releaseNotes: >-
  ChatGPT said:This release brings several highly requested features and important refinements. You can now create and manage sub-accounts, a long-awaited addition that makes team organization much easier. It also introduces unassigned tasks that anyone in a group can pick up, along with the ability to assign users directly within a sentence using the “@” symbol.
  
  
  On the improvement side, the update enhances frontend performance, resolves issues where task operations didn’t appear immediately, and fixes SSO login problems (currently supported only on the web version). A range of smaller frontend and UI tweaks further polish the overall experience.
