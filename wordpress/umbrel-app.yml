  **Note:** WordPress can be used locally within your network. However, if you want others outside your local network to access your instance, you'll need to make it accessible on the public internet.  
  If you have a domain name, the easiest way to make it accessible is to use the Cloudflare Tunnel or Nginx Proxy Manager apps in the Umbrel App Store and point your domain name to "http://wordpress_app_1" (port 80).


  For it to work you need to set the **WordPress Address (URL)** and **Site Address (URL)** to your domain name in the WordPress settings.
  Also make sure to set the **correct headers** in the Nginx Proxy Manager or Cloudflare Tunnel app. More information can be found here: https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/security/https/#using-a-reverse-proxy
