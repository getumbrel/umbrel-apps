  OpenCode is an open source AI coding agent designed to enhance your development
  workflow across terminal, IDE, and desktop environments. Use it to chat about
  code, generate changes, and execute sophisticated multi-session workflows across
  your projects.


  Key features include support for multiple AI model providers (including Claude,
  GPT-4, and local models), intelligent context-aware code suggestions via LSP
  integration, and the ability to perform complex refactoring tasks. OpenCode can
  help you write new features, debug issues, refactor code, and explain complex
  codebases in natural language.


  With its flexible architecture, you can use your preferred AI models while
  maintaining full control over your code and data. The agent understands your
  project structure, dependencies, and coding patterns to provide relevant and
  actionable suggestions.
