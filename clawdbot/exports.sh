# Clawdbot Umbrel Exports
# =======================
# This file exports environment variables that other Umbrel apps can use
# to interact with Clawdbot.
#
# Currently, Clawdbot does not export any variables for other apps.
# This file is required by the Umbrel app framework but can be empty.

# Uncomment and customize if you want to expose Clawdbot's API to other apps:
# export CLAWDBOT_API_URL="http://clawdbot_gateway_1:18789"
