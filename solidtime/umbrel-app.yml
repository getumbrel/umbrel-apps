  🕒 Solidtime is a simple, secure, and private time tracking app that helps you keep track of your time and stay productive. It's designed to be easy to use and respects your privacy by storing your data locally.


  📊 Features:
    - Track your time with a simple and intuitive interface
    - View detailed reports of your time usage
    - Export your data to CSV for further analysis
    - Secure and private: your data is stored locally on your Umbrel

  ⚠️ New users can only be created via the terminal for now. Example:

  `sudo docker exec -i solidtime_scheduler_1 bash -c "echo '<password' | php artisan admin:user:create '<username>' '<email>' --ask-for-password --verify-email"`


  💻 To be able to use the Desktop Client, a Client ID is needed. 
    - Use the Umbrel Files App and navigate to **Apps/Solidtime**
    - A file called `desktop_client_id.txt` can be found there that contains the ID that you need to get started


  The application takes a few minutes until it becomes available after installation. Please be patient.
