  - Automatic reconciliation of BTCPayServer payments to QuickBooks
  - Support for multiple reconciliation modes (Deposit, Invoicing, QBO-first)
  - Secure OAuth2 integration with QuickBooks Online
  - SQLite database with encrypted secrets storage
  - Webhook processing for real-time payment reconciliation
