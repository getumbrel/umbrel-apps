version: "0.17.0"
tagline: A complete and local NVR
description: >-
  A complete and local NVR designed for Home Assistant with AI object detection. 
  Uses OpenCV and Tensorflow to perform realtime object detection locally for IP cameras.


  🛠️ SET-UP


  - You can configure your cameras directly within the Frigate app, there is no need to manually edit the configuration files.


  - Your RTSP password (if needed) is the "default app password" that is displayed on Frigate's page in the app store (shown after install).
releaseNotes: >-
  ⚠️ As usual, Frigate will attempt to update its configuration automatically. It is still recommended to back up your current config and database before upgrading.


  🚨 This is a major release with several breaking changes:
    - GenAI config restructured: global `genai` now only configures the provider; other fields moved under `objects -> genai`
    - Recordings retention is now fully tiered with separate `record -> continuous` and `record -> motion` fields
    - LPR models updated: most users should manually switch to the `small` model
    - `strftime_fmt` has been fully removed; date/time formatting is now based on UI language selection
    - Camera auto-detection resolution logic has changed; you may need to explicitly set `detect` width and height if Frigate hangs on startup
    - The `exec`, `expr`, and `echo` sources for go2rtc are now removed by default to reduce security risk
    - Nvidia GTX 900 series GPUs are no longer supported


  New features and improvements in this update include:
    - New classification model training: train local models for state classification (e.g. gate open/closed) and object classification (e.g. identify specific dogs or people)
    - Custom viewer roles to limit user access to specific cameras
    - GenAI can now summarize review items with a title, description, and activity classification
    - Semantic Search Triggers to automate actions when a tracked object matches an image or description
    - Nvidia GPU performance improved with CUDA Graphs support
    - Intel OpenVINO now supports NPU inference with reduced memory and CPU usage
    - RKNN improvements including automatic ONNX model conversion and accelerated enrichment support
    - Apple Silicon NPU object detection support
    - YOLOv9 support on Google Coral devices
    - New community-supported detectors: MemryX, Degirum SDK, and Synaptics
    - Add Camera Wizard in the UI to add cameras without editing config files
    - Many more settings can now be saved dynamically without restarting Frigate
    - Configuration Safe Mode highlights invalid config issues in the UI
    - Audio transcription support using local models
    - LPR normalization configuration and updated PaddleOCR models with Chinese character support
    - IPv6 can now be toggled via config
    - Revamped Settings menu with sidebar navigation
