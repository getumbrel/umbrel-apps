tagline: Self-hosted Kanban boards for workgroups
description: >-
  Planka is a beautiful, real-time Kanban board for managing projects and tasks
  with your team. Think Trello, but fully self-hosted and under your control.


  Create projects, boards, lists, and cards with an intuitive drag-and-drop
  interface. Assign team members to cards, set due dates, track time, attach
  files, and collaborate through comments—all with Markdown support.


  Changes sync instantly across all users, so your whole team stays on the same
  page without refreshing. Filter tasks by members or labels, customize your
  board backgrounds, and organize work exactly how you want.


  Whether you're managing a software project, planning a home renovation, or
  coordinating with a small team, Planka gives you a clean, focused workspace
  without the clutter of enterprise tools—and without sending your data to
  someone else's server.
