  increments, and remove pages.

  Convert PDFs to and from images, convert any common file to PDF, and convert PDF to Word, PowerPoint, and other formats. You can
  also convert HTML, URLs, and Markdown to PDF.


  🛡️ Security & Permissions
  
  Add and remove passwords, change or set PDF permissions, add watermarks, certify or sign PDFs, sanitize PDFs, and auto-redact text
  for enhanced security.


  🛠️ Other Operations:
  
  Add, generate, or write signatures, repair PDFs, detect and remove blank pages, compare two PDFs and show differences in text, add
  images to PDFs, compress PDFs to decrease their filesize, extract images from PDF, add page numbers, perform OCR on PDF, convert PDF/A,
  edit metadata, flatten PDFs, and get all information on a PDF to view or export as JSON.
