  📄 Page Operations

  Stirling PDF provides a full interactive GUI for merging, splitting, rotating, and moving PDFs and their pages. You can view and
  modify multi-page PDFs with custom viewing, sorting, and searching options. On-page edit features like annotation, drawing, and
  adding text and images are also available. You can also reorganize PDF pages into different orders, rotate PDFs in 90-degree
  increments, and remove pages.

  Convert PDFs to and from images, convert any common file to PDF, and convert PDF to Word, PowerPoint, and other formats. You can
  also convert HTML, URLs, and Markdown to PDF.


  🛡️ Security & Permissions

  Add and remove passwords, change or set PDF permissions, add watermarks, certify or sign PDFs, sanitize PDFs, and auto-redact text
  for enhanced security.


  🛠️ Other Operations:

  Add, generate, or write signatures, repair PDFs, detect and remove blank pages, compare two PDFs and show differences in text, add
  images to PDFs, compress PDFs to decrease their filesize, extract images from PDF, add page numbers, perform OCR on PDF, convert PDF/A,
  edit metadata, flatten PDFs, and get all information on a PDF to view or export as JSON.
