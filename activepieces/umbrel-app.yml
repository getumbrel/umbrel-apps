  🤯 Welcome to Activepieces


  Your friendliest open source all-in-one automation tool, designed to be extensible through a type-safe pieces framework written in Typescript.



  🔥 Why Activepieces is Different:
    - 💖 Loved by Everyone: Intuitive interface and great experience for both technical and non-technical users with a quick learning curve.

    - 🌐 Open Ecosystem: All pieces are open source and available on npmjs.com, 60% of the pieces are contributed by the community.

    - 🛠️ Pieces are written in Typescript: Pieces are npm packages in TypeScript, offering full customization with the best developer experience, including hot reloading for local piece development on your machine. 😎

    - 🤖 AI-Ready: Native AI pieces let you experiment with various providers, or create your own agents using our AI SDK, and there is Copilot to help you build flows inside the builder.

    - 🏢 Enterprise-Ready: Developers set up the tools, and anyone in the organization can use the no-code builder. Full customization from branding to control.

    - 🔒 Secure by Design: Self-hosted and network-gapped for maximum security and control over your data.

    - 🧠 Human in the Loop: Delay execution for a period of time or require approval. These are just pieces built on top of the piece framework, and you can build many pieces like that. 🎨

    - 💻 Human Input Interfaces: Built-in support for human input triggers like "Chat Interface" 💬 and "Form Interface" 📝
