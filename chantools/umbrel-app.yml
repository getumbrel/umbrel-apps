  You might want to visit https://www.node-recovery.com/chantools for more
  information about what commands to run and how to compose those commands.
  
  
  Also, you don't have to run chantools on Umbrel specifically. You can download
  and run it on any machine, there is no direct interaction with your Lightning
  node required and for most commands you don't even need anything other than
  your seed phrase.
