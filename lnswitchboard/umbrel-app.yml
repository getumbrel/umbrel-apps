description: >-
  Host your own Lightning Addresses directly from your node. lnSwitchboard exposes only the public LNURL-pay endpoint while keeping its dashboard and admin routes local on port 22121.


  Create unlimited Lightning Addresses, usernames, tags, and vanity handles, all mapped to the same backend. Enjoy a simple UI, built-in rate limiting, real settlement tracking, inbound liquidity insights, and a clean activity log for every request.


  Compatible with all major LNURL-supporting wallets and services. No command line, no custodians, no external dependencies — just your node serving your domain.


  You will need your own domain and a reverse proxy to use this application. Click “Help” within the app to open the wiki and follow the getting-started guides.
