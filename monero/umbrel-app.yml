description: >-
  Run your monero node and independently store and validate every single Monero transaction with it.
  This is a full node that will download the entire Monero blockchain and store it on your Umbrel. 
  This is the most secure way to run a Monero node, but it will take a long time to sync and will require a lot of storage space.
