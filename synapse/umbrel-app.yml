description: >-
  Synapse is an open source Matrix homeserver implementation, written and maintained by Element. Matrix is the open standard for secure and interoperable real time communications.


  💡 How It Works


  To chat using Matrix, you'll need a client. You can find a list of popular clients here: https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/


  In Matrix, each user operates one or more Matrix clients, which connect to a Matrix homeserver. The homeserver stores all personal chat history and user account information, similar to how a mail client connects to an IMAP/SMTP server.
  Like email, you can either run your own Matrix homeserver to control and own your communications and history, or use a hosted server (e.g., matrix.org). Matrix has no single point of control or mandatory service provider, unlike WhatsApp, Facebook, Hangouts, etc.


  🛠️ Connecting a Client


  To get started, install the "Element" app on your Umbrel, or install any other Matrix client on a device of your choice. When you register or login through the client, you will need to change the address of the homeserver you are logging into from the default matrix.org to http://umbrel.local:8008 for local access. 


  For seamless connection even when your client isn't connected to the same network as your Umbrel, simply install the "Tailscale" app on your Umbrel and your client device, and use http://umbrel:8008 as the address of your server.
