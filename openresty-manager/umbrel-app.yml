  ‚ö†Ô∏è Be cautious when exposing apps to the public internet. Ensure they have proper security, such as login protection, and avoid exposing sensitive apps without adequate safeguards.
  

  üîß OpenResty Manager uses port 3080 for HTTP (unsecured) traffic and port 3443 for HTTPS (secured) traffic.
  To make your apps accessible from the public internet, you will need to set up port forwarding on your router.
