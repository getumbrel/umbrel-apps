  Expose your apps to the internet easily and securely.


  ⚠️ Be cautious when exposing apps to the public internet. Ensure they have proper security, such as login protection, and avoid exposing sensitive apps without adequate safeguards.
  

  🔧 OpenResty Manager uses port 3080 for HTTP (unsecured) traffic and port 3443 for HTTPS (secured) traffic.
  To make your apps accessible from the public internet, you will need to set up port forwarding on your router.
  Forward external port 80 (HTTP) to internal port 3080 and external port 443 (HTTPS) to internal port 3443.
