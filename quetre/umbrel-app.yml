description: >
  Quetre is an alternative front-end to Quora. It enables you to see answers without ads, trackers, and other such bloat.


  Key Features:

  - All requests are proxied which makes it impossible for Quora to collate meaningful data points about you.

  - Absolutely no ads, no tracking, no browser fingerprinting, and no telemetry of any kind.

  - Utilises modern CSS features like CSS Grid and Flexbox to make the website fully responsive for all screen sizes.

  - As the website contains no bloat, pages load in a jiffy and request sizes are tiny.

  - Whether you're a nightowl or bright screen lover, you'll enjoy curated color scheme for your taste.
