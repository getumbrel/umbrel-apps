tagline: A fast and nimble Electrum Server

description: >-
  
  Run your personal Electrum server and connect your Electrum-compatible wallet,
  including BitBoxApp, BlueWallet, Electrum Wallet (Android and Desktop), Nunchuk 
  (Desktop), Phoenix, and Sparrow Wallet to it instead of using a third-party
  Electrum server.

  Highlights:
  
    - Fast: Written in 100% modern C++20 using multi-threaded and asynchronous programming techniques.
    
    - A drop-in replacement for ElectronX/ElectrumX: Fulcrum is 100% protocol-level compatible with the Electrum Cash 1.5.3 protocol (https://electrum-cash-protocol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Existing server admins should feel right at home with this software since installation and management of it is nearly identical to ElectronX/ElectrumX server.
    
      ⚠️ Note: Fulcrum does not yet automatically integrate with other apps in the Bitcoin ecosystem on Umbrel. However, in a future umbrelOS update, users will be able to choose which Electrum Server app they want to use to connect with other apps. ⚠️
