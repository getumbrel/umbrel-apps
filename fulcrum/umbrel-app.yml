releaseNotes: >-
  Fulcrum 2.1.0 is a minor upgrade that adds support for the new Electrum Cash protocol v1.6, which includes improvements mainly for Bitcoin. It also contains bugfixes, optimizations, and improvements to peering.


  Key improvements:
    - Support for Electrum Cash protocol v1.6
    - Better peering behavior - Fulcrum no longer maintains active connections to all peers, reducing connection overhead
    - Fixed an esoteric crash bug when using UPnP with more than 1024 connected clients
