releaseNotes: >-
  ðŸš¨ This update will automatically trigger a full re-sync of your Fulcrum index. During the
  re-sync, wallets connected to Fulcrum won't be able to connect.


  Fulcrum is now far more resilient to restarts, shutdowns, and power loss, avoiding the database corruption issues that notoriously plagued previous versions.
