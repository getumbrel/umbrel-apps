description: >-
  Run your personal Electrum server and connect your Electrum-compatible wallet,
  including BitBoxApp, BlueWallet, Electrum Wallet (Android and Desktop), Nunchuk 
  (Desktop), Phoenix, and Sparrow Wallet to it instead of using a third-party
  Electrum server.

  ⚠️ Fulcrum does not yet automatically integrate with other apps in the Bitcoin ecosystem on Umbrel. However, in a future umbrelOS update, users will be able to choose which Electrum Server app they want to use to connect with other apps.
