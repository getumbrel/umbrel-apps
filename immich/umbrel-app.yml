releaseNotes: >
  ⚠️ To disable machine learning now, use IMMICH_MACHINE_LEARNING_ENABLED=false
  (previously IMMICH_MACHINE_LEARNING_URL=false)

  ⚠️ Sentence-Transformers is no longer used for CLIP models, users who set MACHINE_LEARNING_CLIP_IMAGE_MODEL or MACHINE_LEARNING_CLIP_TEXT_MODEL must migrate to one of the ViT-B models listed here, with the caveat that OpenCLIP models will require running CLIP on all images since the embeddings are incompatible.
  

  This update brings the following new features to Immich:

  - Add the ability to use a configuration file for bootstrapping an Immich instance instead of using the administration web UI

  - Machine learning sub-jobs can now be configured via the administration web UI
  
  - Slide show mode on the web
  
  - and more!
