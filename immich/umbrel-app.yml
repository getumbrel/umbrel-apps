releaseNotes: >-
  ⚠️ Please update Immich to this version as soon as possible. This release fixes two security flaws noted here: https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/tag/v1.82.0

  
  Additionally, it was discovered that thumbnails (which can be downloaded from right-click -> save images as…) contain the full EXIF (metadata) information.  Users are advised not to use the public-sharing feature until a fix is released if they have concerns about sharing metadata.

  
  This update from v1.81.0 to v1.82.1 includes many bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as the following new features:

  - Trash Feature

  - Web Client WebSocket Feature

  - Library Scanning Performance

  - Time Bucket Grouping Accuracy (to take advantage of this feature, please run the job to “Extract Metadata” for all assets.)

  - Storage Template Improvements

  - Notable fix: no longer read iOS-modified photos as “FullSizeRender” 

  - and more!
