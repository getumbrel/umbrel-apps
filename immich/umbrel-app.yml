releaseNotes: >-
  ⚠️ Your mobile app must be on at least version 1.91.0 to work with this release of Immich.


  🚨 iOS Live Photos uploaded after v1.89.0 that are not linked need to be deleted and re-uploaded from the mobile app.
  This is a one-time action, and future live photos uploaded from the mobile app will be properly linked together.
