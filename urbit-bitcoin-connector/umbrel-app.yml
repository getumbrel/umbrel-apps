tagline: Connect your Urbit's Bitcoin wallet to your Bitcoin node
description: >-
  Urbit has a native Bitcoin wallet that you can connect to a full
  node via an intermediary, called a provider. Providers run a piece of backend
  software called %btc-provider that communicates with a full node with bitcoind
  and electrs, as well as a custome Node Express proxy to translate RPC calls
  between TCP and HTTP. This app will install the Express proxy and configure it
  to point at your Umbrel's Bitcoin full node. Using this, you can configure a
  Bitcoin provider on a ship (even one running on your Umbrel) and configure it,
  or other ships to point their wallets at it.


  This app also provides an information GUI web page, with instructions on connecting your provider ship and Bitcoin wallet. The web UI is accessible at port 9090. Note that if your Urbit is running on your Umbrel, you must configure your provider to point at the Umbrel's local/private IP address (like http://192.168.0.10:55555).
