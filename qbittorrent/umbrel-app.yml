  The qBittorrent project aims to provide an open-source software alternative to µTorrent.
  

  Additionally, qBittorrent runs and provides the same features on all major platforms (FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, OS/2, Windows).
  

  Bittorrent is based on the Qt toolkit and libtorrent-rasterbar library.
  

  ⚠️ qBittorrent downloads torrents over the Clearnet, not Tor.
