releaseNotes: >-
  This update brings new features, bug fixes, and UI improvements.


  ⚠️ OpenStreetMap integration is in its early stages, laying the groundwork for future development. The immediate hurdle was abstracting the previous Google-tied logic into a provider-agnostic system that adapts to user settings.


  New Features:
    - Added OpenStreetMap provider (change provider in settings > account > integrations)
    - Added routing functionality for maps and trips
    - Added opening hours to place completion when available


  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed error on shared trips
    - Fixed a couple of UI bugs


  UI/UX Improvements:
    - Added Pretty Print modal to tweak export
    - Swapped trip button icons for clarity
