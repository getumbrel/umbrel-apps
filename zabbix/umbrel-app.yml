  An enterprise-class, open-source distributed monitoring solution that's designed to monitor the performance and availability of network devices, servers, services, and other IT resources.
  Zabbix is a flexible solution that can monitor anything from a simple, standalone application to a large-scale environment, with features including:


  - Resource discovery: Discover network entities, server resources, and onboard/offboard devices. Use out-of-the-box integrations (templates) to monitor anything form a low-level device to a SAAS service.
  
  - Metric acquisition: Use an agent or agent-less approach for metric acquisition from any source – devices, sensors, operating systems, virtualization platforms, container platforms like Docker, Kubernetes, cloud infrastructures, databases, webpages, Java ecosystems, application servers, API endpoints, business applications, and many more.
  
  - Root cause analysis and problem detection: Count on high-performance, real-time problem detection that correlates both existing and incoming problems and performs root cause analyses.
  
  - Incidents, alerts, and notifications: Receive an alert when an issue is triggered (proactively or post-mortem) in the ecosystem. Use multiple messaging channels (including Slack, JIRA, Microsoft Teams, email or text messages) to get notified about the different types of events occurring in your environment.
  
  - "Single pane of glass" overview: Visualize collected data and monitoring events in graphs, lists, geomaps, and network topology maps.
  
  - Multitenancy and distributed monitoring: Enjoy the convenience of one monitoring solution for multiple data centers, departments, and organizations, and monitor remote locations behind firewalls with remote command execution capability.
  
  - Unparalleled flexibility: Adapt Zabbix to your needs and utilize built-in functionalities, including the ability to stream metrics and events over HTTP, reporting, auditing, security, service SLA calculations, and many more.


  ⚙️ Configuration:


  The Zabbix Agent listens on port 10050. To monitor the Zabbix server itself, navigate to Monitoring > Hosts within Zabbix, and modify the "Zabbix server" host by adding the DNS name "zabbix_zabbix-agent_1" and toggling the "Connect to DNS" option.
