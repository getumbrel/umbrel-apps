tagline: Become an oracle and create Bitcoin bets
description: >-
  Krystal Bull allows you to become a Bitcoin oracle. An oracle
  allows information from the real world (financial markets, sporting events,
  elections, etc) to be used to create and settle Bitcoin bets.


  The oracle is a crucial component for Discreet Log Contracts (DLC). Without a trustworthy oracle, you cannot create a bet on Bitcoin using DLCs. Trustworthy oracles are a building block to realizing Bitcoin DeFi.


  To see some example oracles, please visit oracle.suredbits.com.


  WARNING: This version of Krystal Bull is an early alpha release for testing. It's not secure, please don't use it for anything serious.
