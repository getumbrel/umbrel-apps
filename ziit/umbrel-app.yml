description: >-
  Ziit (pronounced 'tseet') is an open-source, self-hostable alternative to WakaTime. It provides a clean, minimal, and fast dashboard for displaying coding statistics, while ensuring privacy by keeping all data on your own server. Ziit tracks coding activity such as projects, languages, editors, files, branches, operating systems, and time spent coding all presented in a familiar interface inspired by Plausible Analytics.
releaseNotes: >-
  Migration to Nuxt 4, which should improve performance. The instance now has a stats page that is publicly available and doesn't require an account, with details about the instance's users, heartbeats, tracked hours, top OS, language, and editor. Additionally, you can now generate badges with the badge endpoint to be placed in a README. More info (here.)[https://docs.ziit.app/badges]
