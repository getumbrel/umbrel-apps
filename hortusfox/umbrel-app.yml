  🌿 HortusFox is a self-hosted web application designed for plant lovers who want to manage their houseplants and gardens in a structured and privacy-respecting way. It is completely free and open-source, allowing users to customize and extend the software to suit their personal needs. Whether you're taking care of a few potted plants on your windowsill or managing a large garden, HortusFox provides a digital space to track, organize, and plan all aspects of plant care.


  At its core, HortusFox enables you to catalog your plants with detailed information such as species names, notes, custom attributes, and images. Plants can be grouped by location, making it easier to manage different rooms or outdoor spaces. The system supports recurring tasks and reminders for activities like watering, fertilizing, or repotting, helping you maintain a consistent care routine.


  HortusFox goes beyond plant tracking by offering tools for managing related items such as pots, fertilizers, and tools. This inventory feature helps keep your gardening supplies organized and accounted for. For outdoor gardeners, weather data integration supports better decision-making by aligning care schedules with current conditions.


  The application is collaborative by design. If multiple users are managing the same plant collection, a built-in group chat function allows them to communicate and coordinate tasks. HortusFox also includes a built-in plant recognition feature to assist with identifying unknown species.


  The interface is responsive and works across devices, ensuring that plant information and task management are easily accessible whether you're at your computer or out in the garden with your phone. Users can also personalize their experience by selecting from various themes to match their aesthetic preferences.


  HortusFox is ideal for individuals and families who enjoy caring for plants and want a modern, secure, and customizable way to support their gardening routines. With its thoughtful design and rich feature set, it transforms the way people interact with their green spaces.
