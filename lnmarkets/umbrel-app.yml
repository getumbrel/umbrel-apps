  LN Markets is the first Lightning-native Bitcoin derivatives
  trading platform.


  LN Markets enables traders to take minimal counterparty risk: you can trade directly from your Lightning wallet for instant and almost costless transactions. Since March 2020, we have processed over $500 million of trading volume, with a median fee of 1 sat for instant P&L delivery to your wallet.


  This Umbrel App gives you another way to interact with LN Markets: you can directly deposit, withdraw, get trading stats and get instantly connected to your account to take positions as usual. More features may come in the future!
