description: >-
  NocoDB is an open-source platform that converts databases into smart, collaborative spreadsheets. It enables users to create no-code applications on top of databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and even Airtable-like interfaces on existing data structures. 


  Features:

  📊 Smart Spreadsheet Interface: A rich, intuitive UI with features like Sort, Filter, Hide, and specialized column types (Attachment, JSON, Rating, Formula).


  🤖 Native MCP Server Support: Enable AI agents (like Claude or local LLMs) to securely interact with your database records using the Model Context Protocol.


  ⚡ REST API: It automatically generates REST APIs for each table, so users can integrate with other apps, create automations, or develop custom workflows.


  🔄 Webhooks: Trigger workflows and integrate with third-party apps like Slack, Discord, and Email directly from your database events.


  🔌 Connect to Any Database: You can easily connect to new or existing SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) and manage them visually.


  🎨 Customizable Views: Switch between Grid, Gallery, Kanban, and Form views to visualize your data exactly how you need it.


  🛡️ Permissions & Roles: NocoDB supports user roles, access controls, and permissions, making it suitable for team use.
