  *No third party JavaScript. Whoogle can be used with JavaScript disabled, but if enabled, uses JavaScript for things like presenting search suggestions.

  **No third party cookies. Whoogle uses server side cookies (sessions) to store non-sensitive configuration settings such as theme, language, etc. Just like with JavaScript, cookies can be disabled and not affect Whoogle's search functionality.

  ***If deployed to a remote server, or configured to send requests through a VPN, Tor, proxy, etc.

releaseNotes: >-
  ⚠️ Google's recent changes have made it difficult to provide JavaScript-free search results, which may affect Whoogle's functionality.


  This release brings new options to help maintain functionality as Google continues to restrict access:
    - Google Custom Search Engine support with Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) as a fallback option when traditional scraping is blocked
    - AI Overview removal filter to automatically hide Google's AI sections from search results
    - Modern Google Images support with improved parsing and layout
    - Ability to see your current User Agent string at the bottom of results for troubleshooting
    - Fixed image search functionality
    - Refactored configuration and session management for better reliability
