  *No third party JavaScript. Whoogle can be used with JavaScript disabled, but if enabled, uses JavaScript for things like presenting search suggestions.

  **No third party cookies. Whoogle uses server side cookies (sessions) to store non-sensitive configuration settings such as theme, language, etc. Just like with JavaScript, cookies can be disabled and not affect Whoogle's search functionality.

  ***If deployed to a remote server, or configured to send requests through a VPN, Tor, proxy, etc.

releaseNotes: >-
  ⚠️ Google's recent changes have made it difficult to provide JavaScript-free search results, which may affect Whoogle's functionality.


  This release reverts the Mullvad Leta implementation and introduces new features to improve search reliability:
    - Added a feature to randomly generate User Agent (UA) strings based on working patterns
    - Option to use your own rotating list of UAs or a static UA
    - A configuration toggle to display the active UA at the bottom of search results for debugging
    - Introduced two new tools: one to generate offline UA lists and another to automatically test them
    - Maps, Videos, and News searches are now working again
    - ⚠️ Known issue: Image Search still displays an "Update your browser" message
