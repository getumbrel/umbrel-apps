  Get Google search results, but without any ads, javascript, AMP links,

  both desktop and mobile.

  *No third party JavaScript. Whoogle can be used with JavaScript disabled, but if enabled, uses JavaScript for things like presenting search suggestions.

  **No third party cookies. Whoogle uses server side cookies (sessions) to store non-sensitive configuration settings such as theme, language, etc. Just like with JavaScript, cookies can be disabled and not affect Whoogle's search functionality.

  ***If deployed to a remote server, or configured to send requests through a VPN, Tor, proxy, etc.
