  Get Google search results, but without any ads, javascript, AMP links,

  Quick and simple to implement as a primary search engine replacement on 
  both desktop and mobile.

  - No cookies**

  - No tracking/linking of your personal IP address***

  - No AMP links

  - No URL tracking tags (i.e. utm=%s)

  - No referrer header

  - Tor and HTTP/SOCKS proxy support

  - Autocomplete/search suggestions

  - POST request search and suggestion queries (when possible)

  - View images at full res without site redirect (currently mobile only)

  - Light/Dark/System theme modes (with support for custom CSS theming)

  - Randomly generated User Agent

  - Easy to install/deploy

  - DDG-style bang (i.e. !<tag> <query>) searches

  - Optional location-based searching (i.e. results near <city>)

  - Optional NoJS mode to view search results in a separate window with JavaScript blocked


  *No third party JavaScript. Whoogle can be used with JavaScript disabled, but if enabled, uses JavaScript for things like presenting search suggestions.

  **No third party cookies. Whoogle uses server side cookies (sessions) to store non-sensitive configuration settings such as theme, language, etc. Just like with JavaScript, cookies can be disabled and not affect Whoogle's search functionality.

  ***If deployed to a remote server, or configured to send requests through a VPN, Tor, proxy, etc.
