  ðŸš‰ Mattermost is an open-source platform designed for secure collaboration throughout the software development lifecycle.


  ðŸ’¬ It serves as a team messaging application that emphasizes developer productivity and the benefits of open-source software.


  ðŸ’¾ Mattermost offers a self-hosted alternative to proprietary SaaS messaging services such as Slack and Microsoft Teams.


  Note: Mattermost can be used locally within your network. However, if you want others outside your local network to access your server, you'll need to make it accessible on the public internet.
  If you have a domain name, you can set this up using the Cloudflare Tunnel or Nginx Proxy Manager apps in the Umbrel Apps Store.

  This release includes various new features, improvements, and bug fixes.


  Key Updates:
    - Downgraded Traditional Chinese language to Beta.
    - Added a feature to schedule a message at a future date (Professional and Enterprise plans).
    - Copilot plugin is now installed and enabled by default.
    - Added an option to test notifications.
    - Added a new search interface.
    - Updated product string for clarity.
    - A 200 response is now returned for HEAD requests to a sub-path rather than responding with a 302. This fixes mobile devices trying to connect to a server hosted on a sub-path.
    - Added the fetchMissingUsers option to PostUtils.messageHtmlToComponent for use by plugins.
    - Added support for exporting and importing bot users via mmctl.
    - Added a warning to mmctl for cases where a user specifies a per-page parameter that's larger than the maximum value supported.
    - Added "ScheduledPosts" under "ServiceSettings" in the config.json file to enable the feature to schedule and send messages in the future.

  Fixes:
    - Fixed an issue with post drafts being unnecessarily saved when changing channels.
    - Fixed an issue where the Web App would feel slower to load than the Desktop App.
    - Fixed an issue where new messages from new channels wouldn't appear in the sidebar after reconnecting the websocket.
    - Fixed an issue with a link in the Compliance Monitoring page banner in the System Console.
    - Fixed an issue that no longer allowed managing user tokens via the System Console.
    - Fixed a SVG image rendering issue by setting conditional width and height attributes in ImagePreview and SizeAwareImage components.
    - Fixed an issue with the web app status not being updated correctly for the current user.
