  ## Simplify your decentralized experience with Formicaio

  Formicaio is an intuitive application designed to help you run nodes on
  the [Autonomi](https://autonomi.com) network. This P2P network allows users
  to share storage and bandwidth in exchange for ANT tokens, an ERC-20 token
  on the Arbitrum One network.

  The name "Formicaio" is derived from the Italian word for "anthill"
  symbolizing the collaborative and structured nature of both ants and the
  decentralized network it supports. Just as ants work together to build and
  maintain their colonies, Formicaio empowers users to collaborate and contribute
  to the Autonomi network.

  ## Node management made easy

  With Formicaio, you can effortlessly run and manage nodes through either a
  graphical user interface (GUI) or a terminal. The Formicaio backend actively
  monitors your nodes, providing real-time status updates and statistics, including:
  - Rewards balance for each node
  - Memory and CPU usage
  - Number of records stored locally
  - Current peer connections
  - Peers in the routing table
  - Peers that have shunned the node(s)
  - Estimated total nodes in the network

  ## Customizable monitoring and management

  A settings panel allows you to customize monitoring tasks and node management, including:
  - Auto-upgrading nodes when a new binary version is available
  - Delay settings for node upgrades
  - Frequency of version checks for the node binary
  - Frequency of token balance queries
  - Frequency of metrics and node information retrieval
  - Configuration of the ERC20 token contract address and RPC URL for reward balance queries
  - Displaying node statistics on an external LCD device (via I2C interface)

  ## Connection types for nodes

  When setting up nodes, you can define their connection type:
  - Home-Network mode: Ideal for nodes behind a NAT without port forwarding. This mode activates hole-punching to facilitate direct connections from other nodes. If this not enabled and you're behind a NAT, nodes will struggle to connect to other peers.
  - UPnP support: Attempt to use UPnP to open a port on your home router for incoming connections. If your router does not support or is not configured for UPnP, create new nodes with UPnP disabled to ensure connectivity.

  ## Deployment modes

  For alternative deployment modes, please refer to the instructions in the [Formicaio repository](https://github.com/bochaco/formicaio/blob/main/README.md).
