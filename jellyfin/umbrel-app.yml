description: >-
  Jellyfin is the volunteer-built media solution that puts you in control of your media. Stream to any device from your own server, with no strings attached. Your media, your server, your way.


  Run the Jellyfin server on your system and gain access to the leading free-software entertainment system, bells and whistles included.


  Watch your media from a web browser on your computer, apps on your Roku, Android, iOS (including AirPlay), Android TV, or Fire TV device, or via your Chromecast or existing Kodi installation.


  Jellyfin has no tracking, phone-home, or central servers collecting your data. We believe in keeping our software open and transparent, and anything we might collect (crash logs, etc.) is opt-in only. We’re also not in the media business, so the only media you see is your own.


  The Jellyfin server and clients are free to download, now and always. There are no costs, hidden or otherwise, to use Jellyfin, either for yourself, for your friends, or for your company. All our incidental costs are paid through donations from users like you.

releaseNotes: >-
  Updates Jellyfin from version 10.8.9 to 10.8.10. This update includes a series of stable hotfix releases that improve the overall performance, stability, and functionality of Jellyfin.

  ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY ADVISORY: GHSA-9p5f-5x8v-x65m and GHSA-89hp-h43h-r5pq can be combined to allow remote code execution for any authenticated Jellyfin user including non-admin users. While the particular execution mechanism of the former dates to the 10.8.0 release, the latter was present for all Jellyfin releases before this point. It is thus absolutely critical for all Jellyfin administrators, regardless of version, to upgrade to this version if they allow any untrusted users and/or expose their instance to the Internet.

  - Fix the canvas size for DVBSUB and DVDSUB subtitles

  - Fix H.264 baseline hwaccel and enable enhanced Nvdec by default

  - Some VAAPI VPP and OpenCL fixes
