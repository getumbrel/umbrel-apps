releaseNotes: >-
  ðŸš¨ Security Update: This release fixes multiple security vulnerabilities that could allow users with existing accounts to escalate privileges within households and share recipes from other groups.


  New features and improvements:
    - Moved "Last Made" and "On Hand" features to household level
    - Added new recipe management options
    - Improved FAQ documentation


  Note: The kitchen timer feature has been removed as it could not function properly when the screen was off or app in background.
