description: >-
  Syncthing is a peer-to-peer continuous file synchronization
  program. It synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time,
  safely protected from prying eyes. Your data is your data alone and you
  deserve to choose where it is stored, whether it is shared with some third
  party, and how it's transmitted over the internet.


  Install the Syncthing app on your Umbrel and pair it with the Syncthing app on your phone or computer for a self hosted peer-to-peer backup solution.
