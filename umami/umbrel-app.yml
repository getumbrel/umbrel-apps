# If true, Umbrel will generate a deterministic password for the app. (optional)
# It will be shown to the user in the Umbrel UI and can be used inside the docker-compose.yml as the $APP_PASSWORD variable.
# This will also override the defaultPassword if set.
#deterministicPassword: false

# If the app is optimized for the Umbrel Home (https://umbrel.com/umbrel-home), you can specify it here. (optional)
#optimizedForUmbrelHome: false

#  # "two-stats-with-guage", "three-stats", "four-stats", "list-emoji" and "list".
#  # To see how they look, visit http://umbrel.local/stories/widgets.
#  type: "text-with-progress"
#  # How often the widget should update. See all available options here: https://github.com/vercel/ms/blob/main/readme.md

#  # The endpoint to fetch the data from.
#  # The hostname is the service from the docker-compose.yml.
#  endpoint: "server:80/api/widgets/disk-usage"
#  # On click of the widget, the app will open. (optional)
#  # The link (which is actually a path) will be appended to the app's URL.
#  # When the link is an empty string, the app will open as if the icon was clicked.
#  link: "/disk-usage"
#  # An example of the widget to show off the widget in the widget picker.
