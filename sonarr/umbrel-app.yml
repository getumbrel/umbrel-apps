description: >-
  Sonarr is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.


  🛠️ SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

  Sonarr on umbrelOS will automatically connect to download clients installed from the Umbrel App Store. Choose from Transmission, qBittorerent, and SABnzbd. Simply install your preferred client(s).


  All you need to do from there is add an indexer so Sonarr can search for shows. You can add indexers directly within Sonarr, or install Prowlarr from the Umbrel App Store for easier management of indexers across multiple apps.
  Add your indexers to Prowlarr and they will be automatically available in Sonarr.
