tagline: Run your own index, block explorer, and command-line wallet for Ordinals
description: >
  Run your own index, block explorer, and command-line wallet for Ordinals. The app automatically connects to your Bitcoin node on umbrelOS for trustless operation. Simply install the app and wait for Ordinals to index inscriptions and runes.


  Use the block explorer to view Ordinal inscriptions. Search blocks, transactions, outputs, and individual satoshis.


  Advanced users can use the command-line to create wallets, create and manage inscriptions, and more. A future umbrelOS update will allow you to run commands from a Terminal directly within the umbrelOS interface!


  Disclaimer: The Ordinals app does not control, filter, or moderate the content hosted on the Bitcoin blockchain. Consequently, you may come across NSFW (Not Safe For Work), objectionable, or unlawful material while using the app.
