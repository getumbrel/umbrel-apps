  LNbits is a simple multi-user and account system for Lightning
  Network that can be used for creating separate Lightning wallets for friends
  and family members. You can also create multiple accounts for yourself to
  mitigate the risk of exposing applications to your full balance via unique API
  keys for each wallet.


  LNbits is packaged with tools to help manage funds, such as a table of transactions, line chart of spending, export to CSV, and more to come. It provides an extendable platform for expanding Lightning Network functionality via LNbits extension framework, and can also be used as a fallback wallet for the LNURL scheme.

releaseNotes:  >-
  ðŸš¨ Reminder that legacy LNbits users (users who first installed a version of LNbits lower than v0.12.2) can access their existing superuser account by logging in to LNbits using the user ID from their legacy admin account.
  As of LNbits v0.12.2 on umbrelOS (previous update), a fresh install of LNbits walks the user through creating a superuser account. 


  This release updates the LNbits app on umbrelOS from version 0.12.2 to 0.12.10.
  It includes numerous bug fixes and improvements, along with a new user manager for easily monitoring users and wallets on the server.
