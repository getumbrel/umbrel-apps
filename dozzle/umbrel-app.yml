tagline: Realtime log viewer for docker containers
description: >-
  Dozzle is a lightweight, web-based Docker log viewer designed for real-time monitoring and easy troubleshooting.

  
  It allows you to view logs of other Docker containers in real-time, streaming new log entries to the web interface without the need for page refreshes.
  Despite its capabilities, Dozzle is a small application that consumes very little memory and CPU, ensuring it doesn't cause performance issues when run alongside other containers.
  It also supports connecting to multiple remote hosts, providing a simple drop-down menu to switch between different hosts.
  Dozzle doesn't store any log files and is solely for live monitoring of your container logs.
  It also features an intelligent fuzzy search for container names, regex log search, split screen for viewing multiple logs, and live stats with memory and CPU usage.
  It also provides authentication with a username and password for added security.
