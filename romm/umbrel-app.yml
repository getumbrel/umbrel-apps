releaseNotes: >-
  ‚ö†Ô∏è There is a bug in this version with partial metadata scans that may overwrite the cover image for games already in your library. We recommend not enabling RetroAchievements and not running partial metadata scans at this time.


  This update brings several new features and improvements:

    - RetroAchievements integration: View your achievements earned on other devices right in the app
    - Improved accessibility: Started a long-term effort to make the web app more accessible with screen reader support
    - Invite links: Generate preset role invite links for easy user onboarding
    - Server stats: View library statistics like size-per-platform in the new admin stats view
    - Added "show playable games" filter
    - Added password recovery option
    - New platform grouping options
    - Support for sorting games by file size
    - Optional 3D tilt effect for cards


  Various fixes and optimizations have also been implemented, including:

    - Fixed issues with screenshot updates, hidden ROMs display, and iOS full-screen play
    - Improved RAM usage and filesystem path handling
    - Enhanced multi-file ROM handling
