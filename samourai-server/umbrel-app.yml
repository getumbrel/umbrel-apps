tagline: Your private backing server for Samourai Wallet
description: >-
  Samourai Server is an exclusive Umbrel app that runs Samourai Dojo
  and Whirlpool backing servers, and provides you easy step-by-step instructions
  to connect your Samourai Wallet to them. Samourai Wallet is unrivaled in
  transaction privacy, but its default configuration is still subject to network
  level privacy loss.


  By default, Samourai Wallet will connect to its centrally controlled Dojo hosted in Iceland. By hosting your own Samourai Server, you can bypass its servers completely when using Samourai Wallet or Sentinel, and gain total financial sovereignty without any complexity.


  Bundles Whirlpool CLI v0.10.15.
