description: >-
  JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. 


  It enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner. You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters.


  Key features and workflows include:
    - Code Consoles for interactive code execution and linking to a notebook kernel.
    - Kernel-backed documents that allow code in any text file (Markdown, Python, LaTeX) to be run interactively.
    - Mirrored cell outputs for simple dashboards.
    - Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers (e.g., live preview of Markdown or CSV).
    - A unified model for viewing and handling data formats (images, CSV, JSON, PDF, Vega, etc.).
    - Customizable keyboard shortcuts and an extensible architecture.


  JupyterLab uses the same notebook document format as the classic Jupyter Notebook.
