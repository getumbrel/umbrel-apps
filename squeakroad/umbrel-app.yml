tagline: Run your own Darknet Market
description: >-
  SqueakRoad lets you run an anonymous market where anyone can set up an account to buy or sell
  anything they want.
  As the admin of your market, you can curate which listings are allowed, and you can configure
  the fee rate to collect from sales.
  Buyers can leave a rating for each completed sale, and the ratings are used to calculate a score
  for each seller account.
