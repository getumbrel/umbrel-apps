tagline: Run your own Darknet Market
description: >-
  Squeak Road lets you run an anonymous market where anyone can buy or sell anything.

  As the admin of your market, you can curate which listings are allowed, and you can configure
  the fee rate to collect from sales.

  Buyers can leave ratings for each completed sale, and the ratings are used to calculate a score
  for each seller account.
