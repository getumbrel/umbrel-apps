description: >-
  Databag is a self-hosted messaging service. Notable features include:


  - Decentralized (direct communication between app and server node)
  
  - Federated (accounts on different nodes can communicate)
  
  - Public-Private key based identity (not bound to any blockchain or hosting domain)
  
  - End-to-End encryption (the hosting admin cannot view sealed topics, deafult unsealed)
  
  - Audio and Video Calls (nat traversal requires separate relay server)

  - Topic based threads (messages organized by topic not contacts)
  
  - Lightweight (server can run on a raspberry pi zero v1.3)
  
  - Low latency (use of websockets for push events to avoid polling)

  - Unlimited accounts per node (host for your whole family)
  
  - Mobile alerts for new contacts, messages, and calls (supports UnifiedPush, FCM, APN)
