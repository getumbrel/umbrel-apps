  ü•∑ Ashigaru Terminal is a terminal based application that enables users to participate in Whirlpool CoinJoin cycles with the goal of strengthening privacy in Bitcoin transactions. It provides a streamlined way to enter the Whirlpool process by constructing Tx0 transactions, which act as the gateway into mixing pools. Once a Tx0 has been created the application coordinates with the Whirlpool system to shuffle coins alongside those of other participants. This deliberate mixing obscures the direct relationship between transaction inputs and outputs, thereby breaking traceable links on the blockchain.


  The application is designed to give users complete control of their own wallets and keys throughout the entire process. Nothing is shared beyond what is strictly required for participation in CoinJoins, ensuring that sensitive information such as master public keys or wallet structures remains private. This principle of self custody lies at the core of Ashigaru Terminal, positioning it as a privacy preserving tool rather than a custodial service.


  Privacy within the network layer is also emphasized. Connections are routed through Tor by default, which prevents observers from linking activity to a particular IP address and makes it significantly more difficult to correlate wallet behavior across sessions. Users retain the flexibility to connect through their own Electrum servers if desired, but the underlying design assumes a threat model in which anonymity and resistance to tracking are paramount.


  The user experience is intentionally minimalistic, relying on a clean text interface rather than a graphical environment. This approach simplifies the task of participating in CoinJoins while avoiding distractions or unnecessary features. The focus remains entirely on initiating mixes, cycling coins through pools, and reinforcing the anonymity set. By maintaining this clarity Ashigaru Terminal makes it easier for users to understand what is happening to their funds and how the process contributes to privacy.


  Overall Ashigaru Terminal acts as a dedicated privacy tool for individuals who want direct access to Whirlpool without added complexity. It balances simplicity of use with strong guarantees of control and anonymity, allowing users to strengthen the confidentiality of their Bitcoin transactions through an efficient and transparent mixing process.


  ‚öôÔ∏è To paste content into the web terminal use 'Ctrl+Shift+V' on Windows or Linux, or 'Cmd+Shift+V' on macOS. In LibreWolf or Tor Browser, it may be necessary to disable 'resistFingerprinting' for the web terminal to function properly. Alternatively, you can use a Chromium-based browser such as Brave. To connect to an Electrum server over Tor within Ashigaru Terminal, enter the server‚Äôs .onion address, select the correct Electrum port, and enable the proxy with the address 127.0.0.1 and port 9050.  


  Please note that updates may not retain existing wallets. Always back up your seed phrase securely, especially before upgrading or migrating.  


  Ashigaru Terminal is designed to be used in combination with the Ashigaru Mobile App. The only official website is 'ashigaru.rs'. Any other sites are fraudulent, as are individuals claiming to represent Ashigaru on social media ‚Äì Ashigaru has no social media presence. Always act responsibly and in compliance with the law.
