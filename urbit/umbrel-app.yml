description: >-
  Urbit is a personal server for self-sovereign personal & networked
  computing. Nock, a functional combinator, is built into Hoon, a system
  programming language, used to implement Arvo, a deterministic operating
  system, that communicates over Ames, a decentralized, encrypted P2P network.


  This app helps you boot and manage Urbit instances on your Umbrel. It provides a simple management GUI, start and stop operations, and passes your +code through the interface.

releaseNotes: >-
  This release moves your piers into permanent storage outside of the app data directory, so they will not be deleted if you uninstall the app.

  `vere-v3.3` is a bugfix release for a regression introduced in vere-v3.2. The new directed messaging driver was assigned an incorrect driver priority which means that ames packets will always be handled before terminal keystrokes or HTTP requests, exactly the opposite of the intended behavior. This would mean that ships getting spammed with ames packets would appear significantly less responsive than before.
  
  This bugfix release restores the ames packet priority to be low and fixes a HTTP caching bug found by ~migrev-dolseg.
