tagline: Run Urbit on your Umbrel
description: >-
  Urbit is a personal server for self-sovereign personal & networked
  computing. Nock, a functional combinator, is built into Hoon, a system
  programming language, used to implement Arvo, a deterministic operating
  system, that communicates over Ames, a decentralized, encrypted P2P network.


  This app helps you boot and manage Urbit instances on your Umbrel. It provides a simple management GUI, start and stop operations, and passes your +code through the interface.

releaseNotes: >-
  Adds runtime support for the doccords system, which is documentation
  parsed from comments in source code (Hoon’s version of docstrings).


  Shoutout to ~datnut-pollen (@drbeefsupreme) for doing the huge amount of
  work required in order to implement this system, which has been
  theorized about for years. To see an example of it in action
  immediately, run # ames in the dojo post upgrade. For the best current
  documentation on doccords usage, see the example file.


  This release accompanies urbit-os-v2.131.
