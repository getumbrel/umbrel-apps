description: >-
  Urbit is a personal server for self-sovereign personal & networked
  computing. Nock, a functional combinator, is built into Hoon, a system
  programming language, used to implement Arvo, a deterministic operating
  system, that communicates over Ames, a decentralized, encrypted P2P network.


  This app helps you boot and manage Urbit instances on your Umbrel. It provides a simple management GUI, start and stop operations, and passes your +code through the interface.

releaseNotes: >-
  vere-v4.x is a major runtime series release with the following highlighted changes:
    - Introduces a completely rewritten allocator that reduces memory usage, decreases snapshot size, and fixes rare loom corruption issues.
    - Implements the mars / urth split, a major refactor of vere’s multiprocess architecture.
    - Adds stateful urwasm jets and declares compatibility with the upcoming 409-k arvo release.
    - Adds support for the 409 fastboot brass pill, reducing initial ship boot time from minutes to seconds.
    - Adds support for the 409 spin hint, exposing call stacks for local performance monitoring.
    - Restores compatibility with 2015-era Intel-based MacBooks and brings back the Windows build.
    - Fixes multiple allocator, signal handling, sorting, HTTP response, and scry-over-HTTP bugs.
    - Introduces the %jinx hint for event computation timeouts and the %loop hint to crash on obvious non-terminating loops, extending %memo use cases.
    - Fixes a regression where shutting down a ship unmounted all desks from the host system (users must remount desks once after upgrading).


  Note: Ships upgraded to vere-v4.0 or later cannot downgrade to earlier runtime versions.
