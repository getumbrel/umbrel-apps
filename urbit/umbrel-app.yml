tagline: Run Urbit on your Umbrel
description: >-
  Urbit is a personal server for self-sovereign personal & networked
  computing. Nock, a functional combinator, is built into Hoon, a system
  programming language, used to implement Arvo, a deterministic operating
  system, that communicates over Ames, a decentralized, encrypted P2P network.


  This app helps you boot and manage Urbit instances on your Umbrel. It provides a simple management GUI, start and stop operations, and passes your +code through the interface.

releaseNotes: >-
  8GB loom has landed, which you can use by adding --loom 33 to your normal boot command. Additionally, comets can now only be booted with the -c flag, the strange page issue is fixed, --cue is added to urbit eval, and authentication requests are checked using eyre's tokens.


  Please note that this release is backwards-incompatible with previous versions, which means that if you boot your ship with vere-v2.0 (this release), you will NOT be able to use older versions afterwards.
