description: >-
  Urbit is a personal server for self-sovereign personal & networked
  computing. Nock, a functional combinator, is built into Hoon, a system
  programming language, used to implement Arvo, a deterministic operating
  system, that communicates over Ames, a decentralized, encrypted P2P network.


  This app helps you boot and manage Urbit instances on your Umbrel. It provides a simple management GUI, start and stop operations, and passes your +code through the interface.

releaseNotes: >-
  This release fixes a guard page bounds check that would usually present
  as a ship crashing with loom: bogus ward. This bug (present since
  vere-v2.7) also has a small chance of corrupting persistent state, so we
  encourage users to upgrade as soon as possible.
  
  The release also fixes a bug with the meld command that was causing it
  to run twice for every invocation.
