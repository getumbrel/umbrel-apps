description: >-
  Urbit is a personal server for self-sovereign personal & networked
  computing. Nock, a functional combinator, is built into Hoon, a system
  programming language, used to implement Arvo, a deterministic operating
  system, that communicates over Ames, a decentralized, encrypted P2P network.


  This app helps you boot and manage Urbit instances on your Umbrel. It provides a simple management GUI, start and stop operations, and passes your +code through the interface.

releaseNotes: >-
  vere-v4.0 is a major runtime release with the following highlighted
  features:
  
  -   A completely rewritten allocator that reduces memory usage and
      decreases snapshot size.
  -   The mars / urth split, a major refactor of the vere multiprocess
      architecture.
  -   Stateful urwasm jets, improving on the stateless urwasm capabilities
      shipped with 410.
  -   Restored compatibility with 2015-era Intel based macbooks.
  -   Declare compatibility with the upcoming 409-k arvo release.
  -   Support for the 409 “fastboot” brass pill that reduces ship initial
      boot time from minutes to seconds.
  -   Support for the 409 spin hint that exposes a call stack for local
      performance monitoring.
  
  Note that ships that upgrade to vere-v4.0 will be unable to downgrade
  runtime versions.
