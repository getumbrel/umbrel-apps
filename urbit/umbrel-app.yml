description: >-
  Urbit is a personal server for self-sovereign personal & networked
  computing. Nock, a functional combinator, is built into Hoon, a system
  programming language, used to implement Arvo, a deterministic operating
  system, that communicates over Ames, a decentralized, encrypted P2P network.


  This app helps you boot and manage Urbit instances on your Umbrel. It provides a simple management GUI, start and stop operations, and passes your +code through the interface.

releaseNotes: >-
  - v1.15 is a revert to v1.13

  From v1.13:

  - Supports setting the loom size on startup. sizes are specified in exponents of 2, from 1MB (20) to 4GB (32); can differ between processes (--loom and --urth-loom); and can be set for relevant subcommands (meld, pack, next, &c).

  - Improves bit-slice performance (for noun de/serialization and many atom jets) by ensuring that implementation inner loops can be vectorized.

  - Adds the vile command, for exporting the keyfile from a ship

  - Adds the %xray hint, for printing the bytecode of a given expression (ty ~topfet-parmed!)

  - Adds the eval command, for running hoon (from stdin) without booting a ship (ty ~mopfel-winrux!)

  - Adds a better error message when a ship is already running as root (ty ~dinleb-rambep!)
