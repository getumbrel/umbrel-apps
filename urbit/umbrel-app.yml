description: >-
  Urbit is a personal server for self-sovereign personal & networked
  computing. Nock, a functional combinator, is built into Hoon, a system
  programming language, used to implement Arvo, a deterministic operating
  system, that communicates over Ames, a decentralized, encrypted P2P network.


  This app helps you boot and manage Urbit instances on your Umbrel. It provides a simple management GUI, start and stop operations, and passes your +code through the interface.

releaseNotes: >-
  The previous release vere-v2.7 introduced a regression presenting as a significant disk read increase when swapping. This issue was caused by a flag meant only for development builds being set in the release build, causing every snapshot write to do an overly paranoid check on snapshot integrity.


  We have now released vere-v2.8 to fix the issue.
