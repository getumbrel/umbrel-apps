description: >-
  Urbit is a personal server for self-sovereign personal & networked
  computing. Nock, a functional combinator, is built into Hoon, a system
  programming language, used to implement Arvo, a deterministic operating
  system, that communicates over Ames, a decentralized, encrypted P2P network.


  This app helps you boot and manage Urbit instances on your Umbrel. It provides a simple management GUI, start and stop operations, and passes your +code through the interface.

releaseNotes: >-
  This release includes runtime fixes mainly aimed at OTA publishers. A
  publisher running vere-v2.10 and urbit-os-v2.142 (releasing in a few
  days) will be able to reliably deliver the initial OTA through remote
  scry instead of falling back to ames.
  
  The release also includes significantly better long-running replay
  capabilities that were missing since vere-v1.14. The <your-ship>/.run
  play command now supports the –auto-meld command line flag to
  automatically meld a long memory-intensive replay. It also supports the
  –snap-at x command line flag to snapshot every x events.
