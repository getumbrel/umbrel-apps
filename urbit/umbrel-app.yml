description: >-
  Urbit is a personal server for self-sovereign personal & networked
  computing. Nock, a functional combinator, is built into Hoon, a system
  programming language, used to implement Arvo, a deterministic operating
  system, that communicates over Ames, a decentralized, encrypted P2P network.


  This app helps you boot and manage Urbit instances on your Umbrel. It provides a simple management GUI, start and stop operations, and passes your +code through the interface.

releaseNotes: >-
Updated Urbit binary to v1.16

- Fix URL with vere repo

This release is functionally equivalent to [v1.15](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/releases/tag/urbit-v1.15) but is built in the [new Vere repo](https://github.com/urbit/vere) using [Bazel](https://bazel.build) instead of [Nix](https://nixos.org) with a new and improved release pipeline. It marks the successful extraction of the runtime from the [Urbit monorepo](https://github.com/urbit/urbit). It also adds a new AArch64-specific macOS build and removes the Windows build.
