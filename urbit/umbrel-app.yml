description: >-
  Urbit is a personal server for self-sovereign personal & networked
  computing. Nock, a functional combinator, is built into Hoon, a system
  programming language, used to implement Arvo, a deterministic operating
  system, that communicates over Ames, a decentralized, encrypted P2P network.


  This app helps you boot and manage Urbit instances on your Umbrel. It provides a simple management GUI, start and stop operations, and passes your +code through the interface.

releaseNotes: >-
  -   Revamped Urbitâ€™s terminal stack. This release contains the first
      phase of a longer-running project towards a next-generation terminal
      experience. Highlights in this release include:
      
      -   Support for 2D cursor movement, and by extension 2D screen
          drawing.
          
      -   Minimal mouse-click support.
      
      -   Faster pasting of large texts.
      
      -   Informal printfs (~&) now get rendered in grey, to visually
          distinguish them from formal dill output.
          
  -   Updated versioning scheme for pre-release binaries.
  
  
  -   The code for the Vere runtime has been moved out of the urbit/urbit
      repository, and now lives in urbit/vere.
