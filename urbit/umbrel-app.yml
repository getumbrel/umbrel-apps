description: >-
  Urbit is a personal server for self-sovereign personal & networked
  computing. Nock, a functional combinator, is built into Hoon, a system
  programming language, used to implement Arvo, a deterministic operating
  system, that communicates over Ames, a decentralized, encrypted P2P network.


  This app helps you boot and manage Urbit instances on your Umbrel. It provides a simple management GUI, start and stop operations, and passes your +code through the interface.

releaseNotes: >-
  A few days ago we discovered a performance issue when a remote scry publisher gets many simultaneous requests, as often happens during OTA updates. This performance bug caused the publisher to do 500x more work than necessary. We have now released vere-v2.9 to fix the issue.
