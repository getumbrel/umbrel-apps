description: >-
  Urbit is a personal server for self-sovereign personal & networked
  computing. Nock, a functional combinator, is built into Hoon, a system
  programming language, used to implement Arvo, a deterministic operating
  system, that communicates over Ames, a decentralized, encrypted P2P network.


  This app helps you boot and manage Urbit instances on your Umbrel. It provides a simple management GUI, start and stop operations, and passes your +code through the interface.

releaseNotes: >-
  Updated Urbit binary to v1.17

  This release includes a new and improved terminal stack, which is
  required for compatibility with zuse 416 (urbit-os-v2.130). It remains
  backwards compatible with the terminal stack as it existed prior to
  this, but there is one purely visual issue: the prompt may seem to
  disappear. This should resolve itself once you receive the zuse 416
  update.
  
  Additionally, as of this release, we no longer support Windows
  platforms. We do not presently have the resources to support non-*nix
  systems at the level of quality we want to deliver. Notably Windows was
  already very much a second-class citizen, as apparent from issues like
  #5822 and others. Windows users may want to run Urbit through WSL
  instead.
  
  Release notes:
  
  -   Revamped Urbitâ€™s terminal stack. This release contains the first
      phase of a longer-running project towards a next-generation terminal
      experience. Highlights in this release include:
      
      -   Support for 2D cursor movement, and by extension 2D screen
          drawing.
          
      -   Minimal mouse-click support.
      
      -   Faster pasting of large texts.
      
      -   Informal printfs (~&) now get rendered in grey, to visually
          distinguish them from formal dill output.
          
  -   Updated versioning scheme for pre-release binaries.
  
  -   The code for the Vere runtime has been moved out of the urbit/urbit
      repository, and now lives in urbit/vere.
