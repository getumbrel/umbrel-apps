description: >-
  Urbit is a personal server for self-sovereign personal & networked
  computing. Nock, a functional combinator, is built into Hoon, a system
  programming language, used to implement Arvo, a deterministic operating
  system, that communicates over Ames, a decentralized, encrypted P2P network.


  This app helps you boot and manage Urbit instances on your Umbrel. It provides a simple management GUI, start and stop operations, and passes your +code through the interface.

releaseNotes: >-
  Updated Urbit binary to v1.16

  Use new Vere repo, fix binary extraction

  This release is functionally equivalent to v1.15 but is built in the new
  Vere repo using Bazel instead of Nix with a new and improved release
  pipeline. It marks the successful extraction of the runtime from the
  Urbit monorepo. It also adds a new AArch64-specific macOS build and
  removes the Windows build.
