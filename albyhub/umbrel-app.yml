releaseNotes: >-
  In this hotfix, app pagination is added, improving the performance for hubs with many apps. Additionally, we fix an issue where Alby Hub will ignore the shutdown signal and not gracefully shut down. A password change bug is also addressed, where HTTP requests are unauthorized until Alby Hub is fully restarted. Furthermore, we add a button to migrate standard isolated connections to sub-wallets and include Wave.space in the app store.


  Key fixes in this release:
    - Added app pagination for improved performance
    - Fixed graceful shutdown issue
    - Addressed password change authorization bug
    - Added migration button for isolated connections to sub-wallets
    - Included Wave.space in the app store
