  Passky is one of the easiest password manager to use.
  On Passky's main page you can see all your saved passwords,
  can search for specific ones, edit them and copy information with just one click.


  Unlike some other password managers, we do care about security,
  that's why users can use both, Software and Hardware two-factor authentication for completely free.


  Passky allows you to import passwords from all other major password managers in just a couple of seconds.
  Not only that, but Passky can also export your passwords to different password managers,
  so you can switch from Passky to any other password manager without any problems.
