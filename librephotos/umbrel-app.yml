  üñºÔ∏è LibrePhotos is a photo management application that helps users organize and browse their photo and video collections with ease. It provides features like face recognition that automatically detects and groups people in photos to make searching simpler. The app uses artificial intelligence to identify objects and scenes in images, enabling users to perform semantic searches based on the content of their photos.


  It supports a wide variety of file formats including RAW and HEIC and allows for automatic album creation based on events, dates, and locations. Users can explore their media chronologically through a timeline view and search their photos by metadata such as GPS coordinates and EXIF information.


  The application also supports multi-user access with customizable permissions, enabling different users to interact with the photo library according to their roles. Additional features include reverse geocoding to assign place names to photo locations and an integrated mobile app that facilitates offline access and synchronization.


  Overall, LibrePhotos aims to provide a comprehensive, intelligent, and user-friendly way to manage large collections of photos and videos.


  ‚ö†Ô∏è Initial setup may take 5-10 minutes depending on your hardware. Please be patient while LibrePhotos gets ready in the background.
