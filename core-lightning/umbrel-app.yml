  lightningd v24.02.2:

  - pay route algorithm doesn't bias against our own "expensive" channels any more

  - pay route algorithm fixed and refined to balance fees and capacity far better

  - prevents repeating the preapproveinvoice check

  - gossip feature bit deprecation for LDK compatibility fix

  - renepay bugfix with situation htlcmax=htlcmin

  - recover plugin can now detect dataloss and guide you through the recovery process, making emergency recoveries less stressful

  - logic of the anchor channels has been overhauled and channel fundings and closing should now be more flexible and reliable

  - dual-funding has been merged into the Lightning Specification! This is a major milestone for more efficient channel management

  - gossip_store file can now be shared with others, since it no longer contains local unpublished gossip

  - optimizations in the way we process blocks means that we can sync with the blockchain 50% faster than before

  - new --no-reconnect-private flag, which tells lightningd not to reconnect private peers. This is useful for service-providers and LSPs if the majority of peers is flaky

  - newest version of the splicing proposal was implemented
