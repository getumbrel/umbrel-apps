releaseNotes: >-
  This hotfix release adds a dedicated `APP_CORE_LIGHTNING_REST_HOST` export to exports.sh,
  mapping the clnrest endpoint to the daemon's internal IP. This was missing from the hotfix.2 build,
  preventing other apps from reliably discovering the REST API host via the standard
  `APP_CORE_LIGHTNING_*` variable convention. The Tor hidden service and RTL connection URL
  now reference this new variable directly.


  **Previous release notes (hotfix.2):**


  This hotfix release restores internal connectivity for Umbrel apps (RTL, LNbits, etc.) that use the Core Lightning REST API.
  The built-in clnrest plugin is now bound to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) instead of only the specific Docker internal IP,
  making it accessible from other Umbrel app Docker networks.


  **Previous release notes (hotfix.1):**


  This hotfix release fixes an issue where users were unable to connect external wallet clients to their Core Lightning node.
  If you were previously unable to connect a wallet, please go to "Settings" in the top right > Connect wallet > and select your desired connection method to see corrected connection details.


  **v25.09.3:**


  This updates cln-application to v25.07.3, lightningd to v25.09.3, and replaces the legacy c-lightning-rest service with the built-in REST interface of lightningd.


  **CLN Application v25.07.3:**
    - Proactive mitigation against a widespread npm ecosystem threat involving malicious code in popular packages.
    - Updated and streamlined environment variables for improved configuration and usability
    - Added support for running Commando over secure WebSocket (eg. wss-proxy) connections
    - Removed version and commit suffix from node aliases for a cleaner display
    - Updated BKPR date format from YYYY-MM-DD to UI standard DD MMM, YYYY
    - Added infinite scroll support for BTC Transactions, CLN Offers, and CLN Transactions

  **CLN v25.09.3:**
    - Bookkeeper has been migrated into core lightning, allowing visibility into payments, fees and channel activities.
    - xpay can now directly pay BIP353 addresses (like ₿cln@blockstream.com) and simple offers without extra steps.
    - Better feedback when channel creation fails due to capacity limits.
    - Now limiting the number of parts a payment can be split on xpay and askrene
    - Reckless now supports the modern uv package manager for Python plugins.
    - Improvements to the rate of feasible solutions found in the main loop of the solver on askrene
    - Splicing improvements allow for better compatibility with Eclair and continuous routing during channel modifications.
    - Improve security by ensuring all peers must support channel type.
    - Payment secrets now mandatory in BOLT11 invoices for better payment protection.
