  Get started with the Lightning network today with Core Lightning - a
  Lightning Network implementation focusing on spec compliance and performance.

  The Lightning Network allows ultra cheap and almost instant Bitcoin transactions.
  By running a Lightning node, you can not only self-custody your Bitcoin on
  Lightning, but also earn sats by routing payments on the network.


  Connect Zeus or any other wallet that supports Core Lightning's REST interface
  to remotely manage and access your node from anywhere.

releaseNotes: >-
  - We reintroduced a number of deprecated features, since some integrations had missed the deprecation window, and asked for some more time to update their apps

  - The new experimental reckless plugin manager can be used to download, install and uninstall plugins on the fly. We have many new features planned for it, so stay tuned.

  - When receiving a keysend any extra TLV fields will be stored so they can be retrieved later.

  - The --database-update=false flag allows users wanting to test unreleased versions from accidentally upgrading the database, and then be unable to switch to a released version again.

  - Several performance issues, particularly for larger nodes, have been addressed


  And much more. Full changelog from v0.11.1 can be found here: https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/releases
