  Get started with the Lightning network today with Core Lightning - a
  Lightning Network implementation focusing on spec compliance and performance.

  The Lightning Network allows ultra cheap and almost instant Bitcoin transactions.
  By running a Lightning node, you can not only self-custody your Bitcoin on
  Lightning, but also earn sats by routing payments on the network.


  Connect Zeus or any other wallet that supports Core Lightning's REST interface
  to remotely manage and access your node from anywhere.
