  Maybe is a fully (your finances are secure) open-source OS for your personal finances built by
  a small team alongside an incredible community.


  This is an early access release of Maybe that is only available to those who self-host.
  Maybe is under active development and is still working towards a stable release with a full feature set.


  🛠️ MULTI-CURRENCY SUPPORT


  Most currently available features will work out of the box. However, Maybe requires a Synth API key if you would like to use multi-currency support.

  1. Sign up for a Synth API key at https://synthfinance.com/

  2. Add your Synth API key to the .env file at ~/umbrel/app-data/maybe/.env
