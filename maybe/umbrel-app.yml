  Maybe is a fully (your finances are secure) open-source OS for your personal finances built by
  a small team alongside an incredible community.


  This is an early access release of Maybe that is only available to those who self-host.
  Maybe is under active development and is still working towards a stable release with a full feature set.
releaseNotes: >-
  This release comes with a wide mix of stability improvements and quality of life updates; particularly for self hosted apps, which can now be "reset" in user settings. If your data looks wrong or you want a "clean slate" to work from, we've added the ability for you to easily perform these resets without writing SQL or manually deleting records.

  This release also comes with a much clearer UI surrounding the Synth data provider. New self hosted users will now see a prominent warning message if they have missing data as a result of a misconfigured or absent data provider.

  Key improvements:
    - Added the ability to reset data in user settings
    - Improved UI for Synth data provider configuration
    - Allow offline trade tickers
