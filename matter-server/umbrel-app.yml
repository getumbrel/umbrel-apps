  🛜 This project implements a Matter Controller Server over WebSockets using the official Matter (formerly CHIP) SDK as a base and provides both a server and client implementation.


  🏠 The goal of this project is primarily to have Matter support in Home Assistant but its universal approach makes it suitable to be used in other projects too.
