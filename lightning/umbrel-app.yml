  Bug Fixes:

  - A Taproot related key tweak issue was fixed in btcd that affected remote signing setups.

  - Taproot changes addresses are now used by default for the SendCoins RPC.

  - A 1 second interval has been added between FundingLocked receipt checks. This reduces idle CPU usage for pending/dangling funding attempts.

  - The wallet birthday is now used properly when creating a watch-only wallet to avoid scanning the whole chain.

  - Taproot outputs are now correctly shown as SCRIPT_TYPE_WITNESS_V1_TAPROOT in the output of GetTransactions (lncli listchaintxns).
