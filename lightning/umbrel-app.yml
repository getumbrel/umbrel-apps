  Connect Zeus Wallet, Zap, or any other wallet that supports lndconnect to remotely manage and access your node from anywhere.


  With the Advanced Settings feature, you can take control of your node and customize it to your needs. Personalize it with a name, enable larger channels, limit channel sizes, set your routing fees, optimize your routing strategy, add watchtower services, fine-tune its performance, and much more.
