description: >-
  Run your personal Lightning Network node, and join the future of Bitcoin today.


  The Lightning Network allows ultra cheap and almost instant Bitcoin transactions. By running a Lightning node, you can not only self-custody your Bitcoin on Lightning, but also earn sats by routing payments on the network.


  Connect Zeus Wallet, Zap, or any other wallet that supports lndconnect to remotely manage and access your node from anywhere.


  With the Advanced Settings feature, you can take control of your node and customize it to your needs. Personalize it with a name, enable larger channels, limit channel sizes, set your routing fees, optimize your routing strategy, add watchtower services, fine-tune its performance, and much more.

releaseNotes: >-
  This update includes a number of bug fixes and optimizations, including: a reduction in CPU utilization due to the new mempool scanning safety logic, enchantments to the CPFP logic for anchor outputs, a fix to a peer/server deadlock, and a bug fix for the new taproot channel type that may have otherwise caused a channel to show as inactive until reconnection.
