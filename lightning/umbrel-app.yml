  Run your personal Lightning Network node, and join the future of Bitcoin today.


  The Lightning Network allows ultra cheap and almost instant Bitcoin transactions. By running a Lightning node, you can not only self-custody your Bitcoin on Lightning, but also earn sats by routing payments on the network.


  Connect Zeus Wallet, Zap, or any other wallet that supports lndconnect to remotely manage and access your node from anywhere.


  With the Advanced Settings feature, you can take control of your node and customize it to your needs. Personalize it with a name, enable larger channels, limit channel sizes, set your routing fees, optimize your routing strategy, add watchtower services, fine-tune its performance, and much more.


  Powered by LND.


  An official app from Umbrel.
