  Run your personal Lightning Network node, and join the future of Bitcoin today.


  The Lightning Network allows ultra cheap and almost instant Bitcoin transactions.
  By running a Lightning node, you can not only self-custody your Bitcoin on
  Lightning, but also earn sats by routing payments on the network.


  Connect Zeus Wallet, Zap, or any other wallet that supports lndconnect
  to remotely manage and access your node from anywhere.


  Powered by LND.


  An official app from Umbrel.
releaseNotes: >-
  Umbrel patch:
    - LND will now connect to Bitcoin Core on other networks e.g. testnet

  LND Bug Fixes:

  - A Taproot related key tweak issue was fixed in btcd that affected remote signing setups.

  - Taproot changes addresses are now used by default for the SendCoins RPC.

  - A 1 second interval has been added between FundingLocked receipt checks. This reduces idle CPU usage for pending/dangling funding attempts.

  - The wallet birthday is now used properly when creating a watch-only wallet to avoid scanning the whole chain.

  - Taproot outputs are now correctly shown as SCRIPT_TYPE_WITNESS_V1_TAPROOT in the output of GetTransactions (lncli listchaintxns).
