description: >-
  Run your personal Lightning Network node, and join the future of Bitcoin today.


  The Lightning Network allows ultra cheap and almost instant Bitcoin transactions. By running a Lightning node, you can not only self-custody your Bitcoin on Lightning, but also earn sats by routing payments on the network.


  Connect Zeus Wallet, Zap, or any other wallet that supports lndconnect to remotely manage and access your node from anywhere.


  With the Advanced Settings feature, you can take control of your node and customize it to your needs. Personalize it with a name, enable larger channels, limit channel sizes, set your routing fees, optimize your routing strategy, add watchtower services, fine-tune its performance, and much more.


  Powered by LND.


  An official app from Umbrel.

  ðŸŽ‰ Widgets are here for umbrelOS 1.0.


  This update brings three new widgets for the Lightning Node app, allowing you to keep an eye on your node's stats, Bitcoin balance, and Lightning balance right from your Umbrel's home screen:


  - Node Stats: A widget that displays the number of peer connections, number of active channels, max send, and max receive for your node.


  - Bitcoin Wallet: A widget that shows the balance of your Bitcoin wallet and has shortcuts to send and receive Bitcoin in the Lightning Node app.


  - Lightning Wallet: A widget that shows the balance of your Lightning wallet and has shortcuts to send and receive Lightning payments in the Lightning Node app.


  After updating to umbrelOS 1.0, you can add widgets by right-clicking on the home screen and selecting "Edit widgets", or by clicking on Widgets in the Dock.
