tagline: Zero config VPN to access your Umbrel from anywhere
description: >-
  Tailscale is zero config VPN that creates a secure network between
  your Umbrel and your other devices. Even when separated by firewalls or
  subnets, Tailscale just works.


  Tailscale will assign your Umbrel a stable IP and an auto-assigned domain that stays consistent, no matter what network your Umbrel is connected to. It’s like a local network that works everywhere.


  Tailscale builds on top of WireGuard®’s Noise protocol encryption, a peer-reviewed and trusted standard.
