  Katal transforms your Umbrel into a powerful, self-hosted cloud download manager controlled entirely through decentralized Nostr messaging. No web interface needed—just send encrypted DMs to your personal bot from anywhere.


  Download torrents, magnets, and direct HTTP/HTTPS links by messaging your bot through any Nostr client like Nostrudel, Primal, or Damus. Search IMDb for torrents, track download progress, and manage files—all via simple text commands.


  Multi-user ready: authorize friends and family with unique unlock codes. Each user gets secure, encrypted access through their own Nostr identity. Perfect for households sharing a media server or teams collaborating on downloads.


  Stream and access your files everywhere: HTTP server (port 6799) for web browsers, SMB/Samba share (port 4445) for seamless network access on smart TVs, PCs, and laptops. Direct integration with Plex, Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr, and other media servers.


  Each installation generates a unique, ephemeral bot identity for maximum privacy. Your Umbrel becomes a decentralized download hub—no central servers, no accounts, censorship-resistant operation powered by Nostr's distributed network.


  Built on aria2 for blazing-fast downloads with support for torrents, magnets, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and SFTP. Turn your Umbrel into the ultimate self-hosted download solution that streams directly to all your devices.


  Note: Requires legacy NIP-04 messaging. Most Nostr clients support this automatically.
