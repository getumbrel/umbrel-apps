  ðŸ“– BookLore is a modern web application created to transform the way digital libraries are managed and experienced. It is designed for readers who want to bring order and beauty to their collection of books and comics while also making them instantly accessible. Instead of leaving files scattered across folders, BookLore gathers them into a central library that can be explored and enjoyed directly through the browser. It provides a seamless reading environment where organization, discovery, and enjoyment flow together.


  One of the most defining features of BookLore is its ability to automatically retrieve detailed information about each book. When a new file is added, the application fetches metadata such as title, author, description, and cover art, ensuring that the library always looks complete and polished. This automation removes the tedious task of entering details by hand and makes the collection feel like a professional archive. Users can browse their books with confidence that the information they see is accurate and visually appealing.


  Organization is at the heart of the experience. Books can be sorted and displayed in a variety of ways, including by library, shelf, genre, author, or even mood. This flexibility allows each reader to create a system that matches personal habits and preferences, whether the goal is to maintain a precise catalog or to simply group titles in a way that feels natural. The interface encourages exploration and makes it easy to rediscover forgotten gems within the collection.


  Reading itself is made enjoyable through the integrated BookLore reader, which supports popular formats such as PDF, EPUB, and CBZ. The reader is not only functional but also customizable, allowing themes and layouts to be adjusted so that each session feels comfortable. Whether someone prefers dark mode for nighttime reading or a lighter background during the day, the application adapts to the needs of the reader. This level of care ensures that the act of reading is always pleasant, no matter the device or environment.


  BookLore is also built for sharing and collaboration. It supports multiple users with individually assigned permissions, making it possible to create a communal library without giving up control. Some users can be allowed to upload and edit entries, while others may only be able to read or download. This approach makes the application suitable for families, reading groups, or anyone who wants to curate a shared space for books while maintaining order and consistency.


  Another powerful element is the way BookLore integrates with external reading tools. Through support for OPDS, it can synchronize with many popular reader applications, allowing books to be accessed beyond the browser while still being part of the same collection. This flexibility ensures that the library feels connected and portable, no matter which reading environment is preferred.


  Adding new titles is effortless thanks to the BookDrop feature. Instead of manually managing file names and directories, users can simply place a book into a designated space, and BookLore automatically processes it, retrieves the correct metadata, and adds it to the collection. The process is smooth and requires almost no interaction, transforming what is usually a chore into a delightfully simple act.


  The application also makes it easy to share individual books directly with others. With built in email functionality, a title can be sent straight to a recipient, which is especially useful for sending documents or transferring books to dedicated e reading devices such as a Kindle. This convenience bridges the gap between managing a collection and actually putting the books into the hands of readers.


  The design of the interface is another strength of BookLore. It is responsive, intuitive, and built to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring that browsing the library is equally pleasant on a phone, tablet, or desktop. The layout emphasizes clarity and usability, encouraging readers to engage with their collection in a way that feels natural and inviting.


  At its core, BookLore is more than just a management tool. It is a thoughtful environment for digital reading that combines organization, automation, sharing, and customization into a single experience. By bringing together the functional needs of cataloging with the emotional enjoyment of reading, it helps transform a scattered set of files into a living, evolving library that is both beautiful and deeply personal.
