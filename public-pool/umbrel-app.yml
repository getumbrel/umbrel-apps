tagline: Run your personal node powered by Bitcoin Core
description: >-
  Run your Bitcoin node and independently store and validate
  every single Bitcoin transaction with it. Achieve unparalleled
  privacy by connecting your wallet directly to your node to
  ensure that your wallet company can’t spy on your transactions,
  or worse — lie to you.


  Plus, transacting with your own node also helps keep the entire
  Bitcoin network decentralized; win-win!


  With over 20 advanced settings, you can take control of your node
  and customize it to your needs. Control how your node connects to
  other nodes over Tor, clearnet, and I2P, adjust your daily upload
  limit, set the maximum mempool size, fine-tune its performance,
  and much more.


  Don't trust. Verify. On steroids.

releaseNotes: >-
  This update brings Bitcoin Core 25.1, automatic 'settings.json' corruption detection and repair, along with several new advanced settings such as:


  - Peer Settings: Customize your node's connections and interactions with network peers. For example, you can now adjust ban durations for misbehaving peers.


  - Optimization: Fine-tune your node's performance and resource usage with new settings like maximum mempool size.


  - RPC and REST: Configure access to your node's RPC and REST APIs.


  - and more!


  ⚠️ 'Peer Bloom Filters' is now disabled by default for all users, to enhance privacy and lower the risk of denial-of-serice (DoS attacks). You can read more at https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel/issues/1624.
  If you are connecting older wallet clients that depend on the BIP37 protocol (eg. Bisq), you can enable 'Peer Bloom Filters' in Advanced Settings at the cost of reduced security.
