description: >-
  rotki is an open source portfolio tracking, analytics, accounting and tax reporting tool that protects your privacy. 
  

  The mission of rotki is to bring transparency into the crypto and financial sectors through the use of open source. 
  

  Most importantly unlike virtually every other competing service which consists of closed source SaaS onto which you are forced to hand over all your financial data, with rotki your data is stored encrypted locally in your computer. 
  

  It enables you to take ownership of your financial data!
  
  
  ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️ Rotki is meant to be accessed locally. Hosting it on a publicly accessible machine should be avoided at all cost, unless you know what you're doing!

releaseNotes: >-
  🚨 As always when you are upgrading from an older release, all your EVM history events will need to be redecoded.
  This is something that takes a bit of time (depending on the amount of events) but is required in order to apply all changes since last release.
  The redecoding will be triggered the first time you go to the history events page after you open the new version. You can monitor progress by pressing the 3 dots menu on the top right and then checking how many events remain in the popup window.


  New features:
    - Support for Gnosis Pay, ODOS swaps, and ExtraFI
    - Maker Sky rebrand support (SKY and USDS tokens)
    - Eigenlayer PEPE upgrade support
    - Blockpit CSV import
    - LlamaZip swaps decoding for Optimism and Arbitrum
    - Uniswap V2 and V3 as historical price oracles
    - Calendar reminders for CRV vote escrow lock periods
    - Improved browser wallet address import
