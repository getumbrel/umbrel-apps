  rotki is an open source portfolio tracking, analytics, accounting and tax reporting tool that protects your privacy. 
  

  The mission of rotki is to bring transparency into the crypto and financial sectors through the use of open source. 
  

  Most importantly unlike virtually every other competing service which consists of closed source SaaS onto which you are forced to hand over all your financial data, with rotki your data is stored encrypted locally in your computer. 
  

  It enables you to take ownership of your financial data!
  
  
  ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️ Rotki is meant to be accessed locally. Hosting it on a publicly accessible machine should be avoided at all cost, unless you know what you're doing!

  Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed an error that was creating snapshots more frequently than expected.
    - Users will no longer be able to add duplicate names for an address for all EVM chains to the address book.
    - Eigenlayer native restaking exited balances residing in eigenpod will no longer be double counted.
    - Active/exited validators will now be properly displayed and filtered for validators that are tracked but the withdrawal address is not.
    - Detected tokens will no longer randomly disappear from a tracked address if new events are processed.
    - It will now be possible to refresh counterparty data if loading initially fails.
