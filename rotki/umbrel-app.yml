  rotki is an open source portfolio tracking, analytics, accounting and tax reporting tool that protects your privacy. 
  

  The mission of rotki is to bring transparency into the crypto and financial sectors through the use of open source. 
  

  Most importantly unlike virtually every other competing service which consists of closed source SaaS onto which you are forced to hand over all your financial data, with rotki your data is stored encrypted locally in your computer. 
  

  It enables you to take ownership of your financial data!
  
  
  ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️ Rotki is meant to be accessed locally. Hosting it on a publicly accessible machine should be avoided at all cost, unless you know what you're doing!

releaseNotes: >-
  This is a patch release fixing issues reported over the past two weeks.


  Key improvements include:
    - Restored Polkadot and Kusama balance queries after their migration to asset hub
    - ERC20 transfers will no longer be missed when transaction querying fails due to network problems
    - Proper decoding of Monerium bridge transactions involving Arbitrum or Scroll
    - Compound V3 native token deposits/withdrawals will be properly decoded
    - 1inch limit order swaps will now be decoded correctly
    - Uniswap V4 swaps with ETH fees paid through internal transactions will now be properly decoded


  ⚠️ As always when upgrading, all your EVM history events will need to be redecoded. This takes time depending on the amount of events but is required to apply all changes.
