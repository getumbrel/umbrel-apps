description: >-
  rotki is an open source portfolio tracking, analytics, accounting and tax reporting tool that protects your privacy. 
  

  The mission of rotki is to bring transparency into the crypto and financial sectors through the use of open source. 
  

  Most importantly unlike virtually every other competing service which consists of closed source SaaS onto which you are forced to hand over all your financial data, with rotki your data is stored encrypted locally in your computer. 
  

  It enables you to take ownership of your financial data!
  
  
  ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️ Rotki is meant to be accessed locally. Hosting it on a publicly accessible machine should be avoided at all cost, unless you know what you're doing!

  ⚠️ As always when upgrading, all your EVM history events will need to be redecoded. This takes time depending on the amount of events but is required to apply all changes. The redecoding triggers the first time you go to the history events page after opening the new version.
