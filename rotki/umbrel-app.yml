  rotki is an open source portfolio tracking, analytics, accounting and tax reporting tool that protects your privacy. 
  

  The mission of rotki is to bring transparency into the crypto and financial sectors through the use of open source. 
  

  Most importantly unlike virtually every other competing service which consists of closed source SaaS onto which you are forced to hand over all your financial data, with rotki your data is stored encrypted locally in your computer. 
  

  It enables you to take ownership of your financial data!
  
  
  ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️ Rotki is meant to be accessed locally. Hosting it on a publicly accessible machine should be avoided at all cost, unless you know what you're doing!

releaseNotes: >-
  rotki v1.39.1 is a patch release containing improvements and bugfixes made in the last 2 weeks to address some issues introduced with 1.39.1.

  This release fixes multiple bugs the most critical of which are enabling onchain sends on Windows, fixing wrongly imported and upgraded data and fixing CSV import for generic trades. More improvements and fixes are included.

  Key highlights include:
    - Users will now be able to switch the chain directly from rotki on the on-chain page if they use WalletConnect.
    - Users will now be able to perform on-chain send transactions using older wallets such as Trust Wallet.
    - CSV imports for trades from rotki custom trades, uphold, cointracking, shapeshift, kucoin and blockpit should now work properly and not show only a single event per trade/swap.

  ⚠️ Not all features are working on Windows yet.
