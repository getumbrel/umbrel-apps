description: >-
  rotki is an open source portfolio tracking, analytics, accounting and tax reporting tool that protects your privacy. 
  

  The mission of rotki is to bring transparency into the crypto and financial sectors through the use of open source. 
  

  Most importantly unlike virtually every other competing service which consists of closed source SaaS onto which you are forced to hand over all your financial data, with rotki your data is stored encrypted locally in your computer. 
  

  It enables you to take ownership of your financial data!
  
  
  ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️ Rotki is meant to be accessed locally. Hosting it on a publicly accessible machine should be avoided at all cost, unless you know what you're doing!

  Important Notes
  
  - When opening the release for the first time you will see all your ethereum accounts that have had activity in either optimism or avalanche being also added for these chains. (The only exception to this is if you pull from premium server to a new machine and the old version you sync from has not yet been upgraded to 1.27.0)
  
  - If you have any optimism address you will be asked to create and add a free API key for optimistic etherscan: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/register
  
  - All EVM transaction events (except for the ones you customized) will need to be redecoded since this upgrade made many changes and improvements to the decoders. No action on the user side needed for this, but you may notice longer loading time when you visit the EVM transactions for the first time.
