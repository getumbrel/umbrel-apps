description: >-
  Garbageman Nodes Manager is a modern web-based control plane for managing
  multiple Bitcoin daemon instances. Run Garbageman or Bitcoin Knots daemons,
  import pre-built binaries and pre-synced blockchains, and discover peers
  via clearnet DNS seeds or Tor-based .onion discovery.


  Default Login - Username: admin | Password: garbageman


  IMPORTANT: You will be required to change the default password on first login.
  The application enforces secure password management.


  Features:

  - Modern dark neon war room aesthetic with real-time monitoring

  - Run multiple Bitcoin daemon instances simultaneously

  - Import pre-built binaries from GitHub releases

  - Import pre-synced blockchain archives to skip IBD

  - Peer discovery via clearnet DNS seeds

  - Tor-based .onion peer discovery

  - Automatic Libre Relay node detection

  - Privacy-first with integrated Tor support


  Each instance runs independently with its own data directory, RPC port,
  P2P port, and configuration. Perfect for running multiple versions, testing,
  or separating mainnet/testnet/signet nodes.
