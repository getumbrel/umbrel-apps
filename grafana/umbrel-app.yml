  Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored. Create, explore, and share dashboards with your team and foster a data-driven culture:


  - Visualizations: Fast and flexible client side graphs with a multitude of options. Panel plugins offer many different ways to visualize metrics and logs.

  
  - Dynamic Dashboards: Create dynamic & reusable dashboards with template variables that appear as dropdowns at the top of the dashboard.

  
  - Explore Metrics: Explore your data through ad-hoc queries and dynamic drilldown. Split view and compare different time ranges, queries and data sources side by side.

  
  - Explore Logs: Experience the magic of switching from metrics to logs with preserved label filters. Quickly search through all your logs or streaming them live.

  
  - Alerting: Visually define alert rules for your most important metrics. Grafana will continuously evaluate and send notifications to systems like Slack, PagerDuty, VictorOps, OpsGenie.

  
  - Mixed Data Sources: Mix different data sources in the same graph! You can specify a data source on a per-query basis. This works for even custom datasources.

  Welcome to Grafana 11.4! This is a special release with one new feature, created in partnership with AWS. 
  We’ve made improvements to Cloudwatch so you can query your logs using two additional query languages: Opensearch PPL and Opensearch SQL. 
  We’ve also updated the querying experience by providing a sample of commonly-used queries, syntax highlighting in the query editor, and auto-completion suggestions for complex queries. Read on to learn more about this new feature.
