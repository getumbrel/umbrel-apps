  ChainForensics is a powerful, privacy-focused Bitcoin blockchain analysis tool
  that runs entirely on your own node. Analyze transactions, trace fund flows,
  detect CoinJoin transactions, and assess the privacy of your UTXOs - all without
  leaking any data to third parties.


  Key Features:

  • KYC Privacy Check - Trace funds backward to find exchange connections

  • Cluster Detection - Find linked addresses using common input ownership heuristic

  • Exchange Proximity - Measure how many hops you are from known exchanges

  • UTXO Privacy Rating - Score each UTXO's privacy (Red/Yellow/Green)

  • Transaction Analysis - Deep dive into any transaction

  • Address Lookup - View balance, transactions, and UTXOs for any address

  • Entity Recognition - Identify known wallets and services

  • Wallet Fingerprinting - Detect wallet software patterns


  All analysis runs locally on your Bitcoin node and Fulcrum server.
  Your addresses and queries never leave your network.
