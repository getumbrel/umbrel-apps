    - Cluster Detection - Find linked addresses using common input ownership heuristic
    - Exchange Proximity - Measure how many hops you are from known exchanges
    - UTXO Privacy Rating - Score each UTXO's privacy (Red/Yellow/Green)
    - Transaction Analysis - Deep dive into any transaction
    - Address Lookup - View balance, transactions, and UTXOs for any address
