tagline: Encrypt your wallet on Blockstream Jade
description: >-
        Run a personal blind oracle to encrypt the wallet material on your 
        Blockstream Jade.


        Your blind oracle holds the decryption key to your Jade that is needed 
        to unlock your device. This allows your Jade to remain protected from 
        physical key extraction while also enforcing a maximum of 3 PIN attempts. 
        Your blind oracle does not learn any sensitive information and does not 
        know anything about the wallet on Jade.


        Blind oracle needs a Tor or a Tailscale connection, if you decide to use 
        Tailscale please enable Tailscale's MagicDNS.
