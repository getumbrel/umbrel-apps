tagline: Multisig with hardware wallets made easy
description: >-
  Specter Desktop can be used to connect to the Bitcoin Core running on your Umbrel or an Electrum Server.
  It functions as a watch-only coordinator for multi-signature and single-key
  Bitcoin wallets. At the moment Specter Desktop is working with all major
  hardware wallets including:


  - SeedSigner

  - Specter DIY (optionally airgapped, using QR codes)

  - Blockstream Jade

  - ColdCard (optionally airgapped, using SD card)

  - Passport

  - BitBox02

  - Electrum (optionally airgapped, if running Electrum on an airgapped computer/phone)

  - Keystone (airgapped, using QR codes)

  - Trezor

  - Ledger

  - KeepKey


  Specter Desktop also supports using the Bitcoin Core on your Umbrel as a hot wallet, by importing or generating a random BIP39 mnemonic, but this feature is experimental and we do not recommend using it at this stage. We plan to add support for other hardware wallets as they come up.
