  🔄 Reliable File Syncing
  
  Organize files into libraries. A library can be selectively synced into any device. Reliable and efficient file syncing improves your productivity.


  🛡️ Built-in File Encryption

  A library can be encrypted by a password choosen by you. Files are encrypted before syncing to the server. Even the system admin can't view the files.


  🛠️ SET-UP:

  Seafile is configured to work out-of-the-box when installed on Umbrel. However, if you want to be able to upload files from a domain name that is not umbrel.local,
  open the Seafile app, go to System Admin > Settings and change "FILE_SERVER_ROOT" to /seafhttp.
