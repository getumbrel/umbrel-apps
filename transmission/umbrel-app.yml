tagline: A fast, easy and free BitTorrent client
description: >-
  Transmission is designed for easy, powerful use. We've set the defaults to just work and it only takes a few clicks to configure advanced features like watch directories, bad peer blocklists, and the web interface. When Ubuntu chose Transmission as its default BitTorrent client, one of the most-cited reasons was its easy learning curve.


  Transmission has one of the lowest memory & resource footprints of any major BitTorrent client. Transmission's light overhead is one reason why it is so well suited for home NAS and media servers. Having been used by Western Digital, Zyxel and Belkin, Transmission gives truly impressive performance on almost any compatible hardware.

  
  Transmission is an open source, volunteer-based project. Unlike some BitTorrent clients, Transmission doesn't play games with its users to make money.

  
  We don't bundle toolbars, pop-up ads, flash ads, twitter tools, or anything else. It doesn't hold some features back for a payware version. We don't track our users. Our website and forums have no third-party ads or analytics.


  ⚠️ Transmission downloads torrents over the Clearnet, not Tor.

releaseNotes: >-
  🎉 Widgets are here for umbrelOS 1.0.


  This update brings two new widgets for Transmission, allowing you to monitor the status of your torrents right from your Umbrel's home screen:


  - Status: A widget that displays the number of downloading, seeding, stopped, and queued torrents.


  - Active Torrents Monitor: A widget that shows your active torrents and their download and upload speeds.


  After updating to umbrelOS 1.0, you can add widgets by right-clicking on the home screen and selecting "Edit widgets", or by clicking on Widgets in the Dock.


  This release also updates Transmission to version 4.0.5. Full release notes are available at https://github.com/transmission/transmission/releases
