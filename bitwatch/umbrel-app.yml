tagline: Monitor Bitcoin addresses in real-time
description: >-
  Monitor Bitcoin addresses in the mempool and on-chain using the mempool.space API and websocket.


  Track balance changes, get telegram notifications, and manage expectations for multiple addresses.


  Features:
    - Build list of addresses in collections to sum-up balances accross wallets
    - Subscribes to mempool.space (or locally hosted) websocket for real-time mempool activity
    - Double checks data against mempool.space (or locally hosted) API on a configured interval
    - Track both on-chain and mempool activity
    - Configure auto-acceptance or alert mode of changes (chain_in, chain_out, mempool_in, mempool_out)
      - by default, incoming transactions are auto-accepted, outgoing transactions are alerted
      - all activity is alerted to a configured telegram connection once (even when auto-accepted)
    - Option to use your own local node for privacy


  Recommended to have Mempool + Fulcrum to run privately but not required.

releaseNotes: >-
  This release adds support for extended public keys and descriptors, cleans up UI and fixes several bugs, and adds a complete e2e testing suite.

    - Adds support for extended keys: xpub/ypub/zpub/vpub addresses as a sub-collection
    - Adds support for descriptors (e.g. multiSig: wsh(multi(2,xpub...,...))
    - extended keys and descriptors can be configured with an initial number of addresses to watch, a gap limit of empty addresses to keep updating on the list, and a skip count to jump over already spent addresses.
    - adds better public mempool.space API rate limiting and a new apiDelay config for being nicer to the API
    - new defaults in config for public mempool.space API usage to better align with rate limits
    - UI impprovements to unify styles, cleanup modules and make buttons cleaner
    - Allows saving default monitor settings
    - Refresh buttons on addresses and descriptor/extended key sets
    - fix bug in reloading on sub-pages
