tagline: Monitor Bitcoin addresses in real-time
description: >-
  Monitor Bitcoin addresses in the mempool and on-chain using the mempool.space API and websocket.


  Track balance changes, get telegram notifications, and manage expectations for multiple addresses.


  Features:
    - Build list of addresses in collections to sum-up balances accross wallets
    - Subscribes to mempool.space (or locally hosted) websocket for real-time mempool activity
    - Double checks data against mempool.space (or locally hosted) API on a configured interval
    - Track both on-chain and mempool activity
    - Configure auto-acceptance or alert mode of changes (chain_in, chain_out, mempool_in, mempool_out)
      - by default, incoming transactions are auto-accepted, outgoing transactions are alerted
      - all activity is alerted to a configured telegram connection once (even when auto-accepted)
    - Option to use your own local node for privacy


  Recommended to have Mempool + Fulcrum to run privately but not required.
