  ⚠️ By default, Super Productivity stores your data (like tasks and settings) in the browser on the device you're using to access it.
  This means your data stays tied to that browser and device and it won't automativelly sync elsewhere and could be lost if you clear your browser data or use a different device.


  ⚙️ To save and sync your data across devices, you can go to the in-app settings and connect to Dropbox or a custom WebDAV server such as Nextcloud.
