  ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: If you are using both the Tallycoin Connect and Home Assistant apps on your Umbrel,
  please update Tallycoin Connect to the latest version before updating Home Assistant. This step
  ensures a smooth operation by preventing any port conflicts between the two apps.
  

  This update changes the port that Tallycoin Connect runs on from 8123 to 8124. This is to avoid a
  port conflict with the Home Assistant app, which now runs on port 8123.


  There are no updates to the Tallycoin Connect app itself.
