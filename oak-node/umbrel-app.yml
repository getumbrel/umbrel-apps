  Oak Node gives you Scheduled Sends. Use it to schedule recurring tips to LNURL or Lightning Addresses. 


  For Nostriches out there, the included Nostr bot gives you control over your sats from any Nostr client.
releaseNotes: >-
  Ever wanted a fancier Nostr pubkey, but didn't want to mine it yourself?
  Oak now has a PowPub Client, which lets you buy the mining of vanity pubkeys from mining providers.
  It uses a split-key approach, so the keys are known only to you.
