  ⚠️ Attention

  If you already have your Mikrotik service configured, keep in mind that when updating the app to a new version from the Umbrel app store, your Mikrotik settings will be lost, so make a backup first. To update your CHR's firmware without losing your settings, in the app go to System > Packages > Check For Updates > Download&Install.
