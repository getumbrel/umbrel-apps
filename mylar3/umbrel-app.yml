description: >-

  Mylar allows you to create a watchlist of series that it monitors for various things (new issues, updated information, etc). It will grab, sort, and rename downloaded issues. It will also allow you to monitor weekly pull-lists for items belonging to said watchlisted series to download, as well as being able to monitor and maintain story-arcs.

  It's running - now what?


  The 2 most important things you need prior to doing anything -

  add your ComicVine API Key


  set your Comic Location path


  Both are set via the gears icon (configuration settings) located in the upper right of the page -


  ComicVine API Key


  Set the ComicVine (CV) API Key on the 2nd tab of the Configuration page (Web Interface). Make sure that there are no spaces at the beginning and end, as well as removing the word None if it's present prior to entering the key. Without the CV API Key, Mylar cannot search/add/update series, so it's kind of important.


  Comic Location path

  Just beneath that is the Comic Location field. This is the location where you want Mylar to start storing comics (ie. the root) - when adding series, post-processing issues, metatagging, renaming, etc this location is where Mylar will both look and send files (unless changed). Directories will be created beneath the path specified, in the format that is specified (this is called Folder Format and is on the Advanced Settings tab of the Configuration).


  Helpful hints -


  Ensure Comic Location is specified in the configuration (Configuration --> Web Interface --> Comic Location)


  Mylar auto-creates the comic series directories under the Comic Location. The directory is displayed on the Comic Detail page).

  
  If you do not want directories to be created until there are issues present, set create_folders = False in the config.ini.


  A search provider needs to be specified to perform any search-related functions
  
  
  Enabling Automatically Mark Upcoming Issues as Wanted in settings will mark any NEW comic from the Pullist that is on your 'watchlist' as wanted
  
  
  Add a comic (series) using the Search button or via the Weekly tab (which shows the weekly Pull-list).
  
  
  If you know the CV comicid, enter the full id into the search box (ie. 4050-XXXXX)
  
  
  If adding a comic fails with "Error", submit a bug and it will be checked out (usually an easy fix)
  
  
  Post-Processing is for adding new issues into existing series on your watchlist, Import is for adding files for series that don't exist on your watchlist into your watchlist
  
  
  For the most up-to-date build, use the python3-dev build
  
  
  Master doesn't get updated as frequently (> month), and python3-dev is more-or-less stable
  
  
  If your comic collection resides on a different computer than your Mylar installation and you have that location as your ComicLocation path - turn OFF enforce permissions (Mylar cannot enforce permissions across different systems).
