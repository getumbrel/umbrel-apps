The integrated food database simplifies meal logging by providing nutritional information for a wide range of ingredients, and users can also add custom food entries.


  To support long-term progress monitoring, wger includes visualization tools such as weight tracking charts, workout performance graphs, and statistical summaries. These features help users identify trends, set realistic goals, and stay motivated throughout their fitness journey.
