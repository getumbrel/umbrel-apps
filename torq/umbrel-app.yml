  Operating a Lightning node requires a lot of work. You need to monitor your channels, rebalance them, keep track of your fees and much more.


  With Torq, you can collect and analyze your data with increasingly advanced tools.


  Features:

  - Workflow based automation.

  - Channel and Channel group inspection, even with more than 1000 channels.
  
  - Advanced charts and visualizations of aggregated forwarding statistics

  - See the channel balance (inbound/outbound capacity) over time

  - Manage multiple nodes at once.

  - Stores all events from your node including HTLC events, fee rate changes and channel enable/disable events

  - Filter, sort and group data

  - Store custom table views configurations for quickly finding the right information

  - Fetch and analyse data from any point in time

  - Navigate through time (days, weeks, months) to track your progress

  - Tag channels and nodes with custom labels (Exchange, Routing node, Sink, Source, or anything else)
