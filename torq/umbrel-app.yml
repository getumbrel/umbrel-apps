  - Advanced charts and visualizations of aggregated forwarding statistics

  - Manage multiple nodes at once.

  - Filter, sort and group data

  - Stores all events from your node including HTLC events, fee rate changes and channel enable/disable events

  - Store custom table views configurations for quickly finding the right information

  - Fetch and analyse data from any point in time

  - Navigate through time (days, weeks, months) to track your progress

  - Tag channels and nodes with custom labels (Exchange, Routing node, Sink, Source, or anything else)
