  - Channel and Channel group inspection

  - See the channel balance (inbound/outbound capacity) over time

  - Advanced charts and visualizations of aggregated forwarding statistics

  - Visualization of sources and destinations for traffic

  - Stores all events from your node including HTLC events, fee rate changes and channel enable/disable events

  - Filter, sort and group data

  - Store custom table views configurations for quickly finding the right information

  - Fetch and analyse data from any point in time

  - Navigate through time (days, weeks, months) to track your progress
