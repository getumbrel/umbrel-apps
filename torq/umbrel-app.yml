description: >-
  Operating a Lightning node requires a lot of work. You need to monitor your channels, rebalance them, keep track of your fees and much more.


  With Torq, you can collect and analyze your data with increasingly advanced tools.


  Features:

  - Advanced decision engine for automation. Create your own logic visually through workflows.
  
  - Notifications via Telegram, Discord and Slack (with advanced logic and templating)

  - Fast even with more than 1000 channels.
  
  - Advanced charts and visualizations of aggregated forwarding statistics

  - Manage multiple nodes at once.

  - Filter, sort and group data

  - Stores all events from your node including HTLC events, fee rate changes and channel enable/disable events

  - Store custom table views configurations for quickly finding the right information

  - Fetch and analyse data from any point in time

  - Navigate through time (days, weeks, months) to track your progress

  - Tag channels and nodes with custom labels (Exchange, Routing node, Sink, Source, or anything else)

releaseNotes: >-
  A lot of improvements have been made in this release. It's hard to cover it all but here are some highlights:
  
    - Add advanced outputs table (UTXO management), with the ability to lock/unlock individual outputs.
    - LND v0.18 support (+ inbound fees)
    - CLN v24.05 support
    - Tighter CLN integration via Torq plugin
    - Fix opening a channel with CLN (missing close-to address)
    - Fix CLN+LND on-chain transaction import (this will reimport on-chain transactions)
    - Torq will import transactions + transaction inputs and outputs
    - We advise to configure bitcoind connection details for extra annotation
    - Ability to integrate Electrum (for unconfirmed on-chain notification support)
    - System/workflow variables/templates in workflows
    - example 1: proportionate fee template: 2000 - ({{Channels.peerGauge}} * 2000)
    - example 2: dynamic max HTLC amount: {{Channels.localBalance}} / 2
    - Channel open interceptor workflow (LND and CLN)
    - Email is now a notification type in workflows (using SMTP)
    - Ability to trigger a workflow via gRPC (and specify workflow/system variables)
    - Manual and automatic emergency recovery file / SCB (for CLN and LND)
    - Automatic includes: email, Github, dropbox, gdrive
    - Beta feature: (Unauthenticated) Implementation agnostic Torq gRPC
    - With methods: GetActiveNodes, GetNodeInformation, ConnectPeer, DisconnectPeer, OpenChannel, CloseChannel, SendPayment, CreateInvoice, CreateAddress, TagPeer, TriggerWorkflow, GetOnChainTransactionsByAddress, GetOnChainFeeEstimates, WaitInvoiceSettledByPaymentHash, SubscribeInvoiceStatuses, WaitOnChainTransactionsByAddress, SubscribeOnChainTransactions
