  🌐 Open WebUI is an extensible, feature-rich, and user-friendly self-hosted WebUI designed to operate entirely offline.


  🤖 It supports various LLM runners, including Ollama and OpenAI-compatible APIs.


  🦙 This app has [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) as a requirement and pre-configured so you can easily get started with your own local AI. 
  

  To start downloading models via Ollama, simply type in a model name in the model search bar and click "Pull from Ollama.com".
  A list of models can be found at https://ollama.com/search.
