  Open WebUI lets you chat with advanced AI models running locally on your own device or connect to online models using an API key.


  **Getting Started with Local AI Models:**


  🦙 Install Ollama: Start by installing the Ollama app from the Umbrel App Store. Ollama enables you to download and run large language models like Llama 3 and DeepSeek-R1 directly on your device.


  ⬇️ Download a Model: In the Open WebUI app, type the name of the model you want in the search bar and click "Pull from Ollama.com." A full list of models is available at https://ollama.com/.


  🤖 Example - Running DeepSeek-R1 1.5B: To use the DeepSeek-R1 model with 1.5 billion parameters, type deepseek-r1:1.5b in the search bar and start the download. Once it's ready, you can chat with the model directly in Open WebUI.


  ⚠️ Warning: Before running a model, make sure your device has enough free RAM to support it. Attempting to run a model that exceeds your available memory could cause your device to crash or become unresponsive. Always check the model requirements before downloading or starting it.
