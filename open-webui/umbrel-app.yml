  Open WebUI lets you chat with advanced AI models running locally on your own device or connect to online models using an API key.


  **Getting Started with Local AI Models:**


  🦙 Install Ollama: Start by installing the Ollama app from the Umbrel App Store. Ollama enables you to download and run large language models like Llama 3 and DeepSeek-R1 directly on your device.


  ⬇️ Download a Model: In the Open WebUI app, type the name of the model you want in the search bar and click "Pull from Ollama.com." A full list of models is available at https://ollama.com/.


  🤖 Example - Running DeepSeek-R1 1.5B: To use the DeepSeek-R1 model with 1.5 billion parameters, type deepseek-r1:1.5b in the search bar and start the download. Once it's ready, you can chat with the model directly in Open WebUI.


  ⚠️ Warning: Before running a model, make sure your device has enough free RAM to support it. Attempting to run a model that exceeds your available memory could cause your device to crash or become unresponsive. Always check the model requirements before downloading or starting it.

releaseNotes: >-
  ⚠️ This release includes database changes that require adequate downtime for migration, especially for larger deployments with extensive chat histories. Make sure you have a backup before updating.


  Key highlights in this release include:
    - Skills now inject full content when user-selected, while model-attached skills show only name and description for flexibility
    - Chat toggles now control built-in tools, allowing users to disable web search, image generation, and code execution per conversation
    - Image preview in file management modal makes it easier to identify and manage uploaded images
    - Batch tag operations and faster group list loading significantly improve performance
    - Skills sharing permissions now available for administrators to control per-group access
    - Fixed OAuth session error handling to gracefully clean up corrupted sessions
    - Fixed tool call message preservation to prevent models from hallucinating tool outputs
    - Fixed external tool servers to initialize automatically on startup for proper containerized deployments
    - Fixed resource handle cleanup to prevent file handle leaks during audio transcription
    - Fixed keyboard shortcut conflict where Ctrl+Shift+S would strike through text instead of toggling sidebar
