  Toshi Moto is a watch-only Bitcoin wallet that allows you to monitor your Bitcoin addresses and transactions.


  It will use your xpub to scan addresses and aggregate balances and transactions across your different wallets.
  It can not spend, it can not sign transactions, it can only be used to track your Bitcoin balance and transactions.


  You can preview the app at https://toshimoto.app


  Philosophy:
  - Privacy first - This app does not use any analytics or tracking software. Additionally, URL routing is done with hash based routing (such as url paths like /#/onboarding) to avoid leaking any information to the server. When used on an umbrel, The browser does not send any part of the request after the hash to the server.
  - Transparency - All source code is publically available at https://github.com/toshimoto821/toshi-moto and licensed under the PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 license.
  - Education - My primary goal is to provide a tool to help people learn about Bitcoin and understand it.
