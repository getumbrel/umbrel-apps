  Mazanoke is a privacy focused image optimizer that runs entirely in the browser without relying on external servers. Developed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), it offers a seamless offline experience and can be installed directly on your device for quick access.


  The app lets users optimize and convert images without compromising their privacy. All tasks such as adjusting quality, resizing to specific dimensions, converting formats, and compressing files are performed locally on the device. Supported formats include JPEG, PNG, WebP, as well as SVG and GIF which are converted to optimized PNGs.


  Mazanoke features a responsive and intuitive interface that works smoothly across desktops, tablets, and smartphones. It automatically adapts to the systemâ€™s dark or light mode for a comfortable user experience.


  Released under the GPL 3.0 license, Mazanoke is open source and made for people who want powerful image tools while keeping full control over their data.
