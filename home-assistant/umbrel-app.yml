tagline: Home automation that puts local control & privacy first
description: >-
  Open source home automation that puts local control and privacy
  first, powered by a worldwide community of tinkerers and DIY enthusiasts. Home
  Assistant integrates with over a thousand different devices and services. Once
  you have integrated all your devices at home, you can unleash Home Assistantâ€™s
  advanced automation engine to make your home work for you. Examples: 


  - Turn on the light when the sun sets or when coming home 

  - Alert you when you leave your garage door open 


  All your smart home data stays local. Home Assistant communicates with your devices locally, and will fallback to pulling in data from the cloud if there is no other option. No data is stored in the cloud, and everything is processed locally.

  For Home Assistant mobile app users, there's an important change introduced since the last version. In your Home Assistant mobile app,
  please use the new port number '8123' to connect it to the Home Assistant app on your Umbrel. If you haven't already made this change, please do so
  now. Alternatively, you can reinstall the mobile app for automatic Umbrel detection.
  

  This update brings Home Assistant to version 2023.7.1, and now includes USB Discovery! The previous update included automatic device discovery for
  devices connected to the same network, and the ability to save your personalized settings and automations.


  This update to 2023.7.1 brings a variety of improvements and bug fixes. Services can now respond with data, Bluetooth proxies are now lightning fast,
  you can copy-and-paste cards between your dashboards, and broken automations no longer disappear into thin air and are, instead, marked as problematic.
