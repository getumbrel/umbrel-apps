tagline: Home automation that puts local control & privacy first
description: >-
  Open source home automation that puts local control and privacy
  first, powered by a worldwide community of tinkerers and DIY enthusiasts. Home
  Assistant integrates with over a thousand different devices and services. Once
  you have integrated all your devices at home, you can unleash Home Assistantâ€™s
  advanced automation engine to make your home work for you. Examples: 


  - Turn on the light when the sun sets or when coming home 

  - Alert you when you leave your garage door open 


  All your smart home data stays local. Home Assistant communicates with your devices locally, and will fallback to pulling in data from the cloud if there is no other option. No data is stored in the cloud, and everything is processed locally.

  ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: If you are using both the Home Assistant and Tallycoin Connect apps on your Umbrel, please
  update Tallycoin Connect to the latest version before updating Home Assistant. This step ensures a smooth
  operation by preventing any port conflicts between the two apps.


  For Home Assistant mobile app users, there's a minor yet significant change. In your Home Assistant mobile
  app, please use the new port number '8123' to connect it to the Home Assistant app on your Umbrel, or
  simply reinstall the mobile app for automatic Umbrel detection.
  

  This update brings Home Assistant to version 2023.6.3, and also includes automatic device discovery for
  devices connected to the same network, and the ability to save your personalized settings and automations!
