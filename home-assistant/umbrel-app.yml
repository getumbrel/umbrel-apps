tagline: Home automation that puts local control & privacy first
description: >-
  Open source home automation that puts local control and privacy
  first. Powered by a worldwide community of tinkerers and DIY enthusiasts.
  Once started, Home Assistant will automatically scan your network for known devices and allow you to easily set them up.
  Home Assistant integrates with over a thousand different devices and services.


  Once you have integrated all your devices at home, you can unleash Home Assistant's
  advanced automation engine to make your home work for you. Do things like:

  - Turn on the light when the sun sets or when coming home

  - Get an alert when you leave your garage door open


  Home Assistant keeps your data local, no need for a cloud. Home Assistant communicates with your devices locally, and will fallback to pulling in data from the cloud if there is no other option. No data is stored in the cloud, and everything is processed locally.


  Note: The USB adapter discovery feature (e.g., for Zigbee dongles connected directly to the device running Umbrel) may not work reliably for Umbrel users on Raspberry Pi.

releaseNotes: >-
  This release delivers meaningful upgrades, led by a more streamlined Home dashboard on mobile, continued progress on “human-friendly” automations via Home Assistant Labs, easier access to protocol dashboards (like Zigbee and Z-Wave), and a strong set of new and improved integrations.


  Key highlights and improvements:
    - Streamlined Home dashboard experience on mobile with summary cards shown upfront (no more tab-based navigation)
    - New Devices page on the Home dashboard to manage devices not assigned to any area (“orphaned” devices)
    - Expanded purpose-specific triggers and conditions in Home Assistant Labs, with many new trigger types
    - Improved automation readability with a redesigned target summary (supports areas, floors, labels, and more)
    - Settings page reorganization to make protocol dashboards (Matter, Zigbee, Z-Wave, Thread, etc.) easier to find
    - Eight new integrations added (including Fressnapf Tracker, eGauge, Watts Vision+, and more), plus notable improvements elsewhere
