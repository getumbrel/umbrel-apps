description: >-
  BTCPay Server is a payment processor that allows you to receive
  payments in Bitcoin (and altcoins) directly, with no fees, transaction cost or
  a middleman. It is a non-custodial invoicing system which eliminates the
  involvement of a third-party.


  Payments with BTCPay Server go directly to your wallet, which increases the privacy and security. Your private keys are never uploaded to your Umbrel. There is no address re-use, since each invoice generates a new address deriving from your xpubkey.


  You can not only attach an unlimited number of stores and use the Lightning Network but also become a payment processor for others. Thanks to the apps built on top of it, you can use BTCPay to receive donations, start a crowdfunding campaign or have an in-store Point of Sale.


  Please note: Due to your BTCPay instance running on your local network connecting remote applications, such as Shopify or WordPress for example, will fail to connect, unless you configure the dynamic DNS feature (see: https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Deployment/DynamicDNS).

releaseNotes: >-
  This release comes with a notable change, new features and several bug fixes.


  ⚠️ **Note**
  CoinGecko's API now mandates the use of an API Key for accessing rates. Consequently, it's been decided to discontinue support of CoinGecko-based rate sources. For those who relied on CoinGecko, invoice creation will now fail, and they must choose an alternative rate provider.


  New features:
    - Cold wallet transaction support via Greenfield API
    - Add Norwegian lang in the available language packs

  Bug fixes:
    - It shouldn't be possible to create an invoice when all store users are disabled
    - Remove CoinGecko and any rate source provided by them
    - Change the default rate source for LTC conversion from CoinGecko to Kraken
    - In monetization, it was impossible to recreate a user with email of a previously deleted user
    - Backend translations would sometimes fail to load during startup
    - Subs plan checkout always showed 'per month'
    - Editing a plan subscription set the Currency back to USD
    - Disable zero amount invoices in PoS doesn't show when Keypad mode is selected
    - Adding labels payment requests would sometimes not work as expected
    - PSBT Scan via Camera was not closing the modal dialog when signing a multisig transaction
    - Selecting some rate source would crash the Stores/Rates page
