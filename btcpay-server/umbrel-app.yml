description: >-
  BTCPay Server is a payment processor that allows you to receive
  payments in Bitcoin (and altcoins) directly, with no fees, transaction cost or
  a middleman. It is a non-custodial invoicing system which eliminates the
  involvement of a third-party.


  Payments with BTCPay Server go directly to your wallet, which increases the privacy and security. Your private keys are never uploaded to your Umbrel. There is no address re-use, since each invoice generates a new address deriving from your xpubkey.


  You can not only attach an unlimited number of stores and use the Lightning Network but also become a payment processor for others. Thanks to the apps built on top of it, you can use BTCPay to receive donations, start a crowdfunding campaign or have an in-store Point of Sale.


  Please note: Due to your BTCPay instance running on your local network connecting remote applications, such as Shopify or WordPress for example, will fail to connect, unless you configure the dynamic DNS feature (see: https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Deployment/DynamicDNS).
