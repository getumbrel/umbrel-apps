  LocalAI is the free, Open Source OpenAI alternative. LocalAI act as a drop-in replacement REST API that's compatible with OpenAI API specifications for local inferencing.
  
  
  It allows you to run LLMs, generate images, audio locally with consumer grade hardware, supporting multiple model families and architectures.


  ⚠️ Note

  Before running a model, make sure your device has enough free RAM to support it. Attempting to run a model that exceeds your available memory could cause your device to crash or become unresponsive. Always check the model requirements before downloading or starting it.
releaseNotes: >-
  This release focuses on stability, resource efficiency, and smarter agent workflows. It addresses critical issues with model loading, improves system resource management, and introduces a new Agent Jobs panel for scheduling and managing background agentic tasks.


  Key highlights include:
    - Agent Jobs Panel - Schedule and run background tasks with cron or via API for automated workflows
    - Smart Memory Reclaimer - Automatically frees up GPU/VRAM by evicting least recently used models when memory is low
    - LRU Model Eviction - Models are automatically unloaded from memory based on usage patterns to prevent crashes
    - MLX & CUDA 13 Support - New model backends and enhanced GPU compatibility for modern hardware
    - Vibevoice Backend - Real-time text-to-speech with voice cloning support
    - StableDiffusion-GGML LoRA Support - Expand your image-generation capabilities


  Additional fixes and improvements:
    - Fixed authentication requirement for health check endpoints that was breaking Docker monitoring
    - Fixed crashes when importing models from Hugging Face URLs with subfolders
    - UI improvements including fixed navbar ordering, prevented tool call overflow, and consistent button styling
    - Model preview now shows actual filename and size before downloading
    - Improved RAM estimation and resource management
