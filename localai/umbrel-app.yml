tagline: Drop-in OpenAI replacement
description: >-
  LocalAI is the free, Open Source OpenAI alternative. LocalAI act as a drop-in replacement REST API that's compatible with OpenAI API specifications for local inferencing.
  
  
  It allows you to run LLMs, generate images, audio locally with consumer grade hardware, supporting multiple model families and architectures.


  ⚠️ Note

  Before running a model, make sure your device has enough free RAM to support it. Attempting to run a model that exceeds your available memory could cause your device to crash or become unresponsive. Always check the model requirements before downloading or starting it.
releaseNotes: >-
  This release focuses on agent capabilities, multi-modal support, and cross-platform reliability. It introduces native Anthropic API support, a new Video Generation UI, Open Responses API compatibility, and enhanced performance with a unified GPU backend system.


  Key highlights include:
    - Anthropic API Support - Fully compatible /v1/messages endpoint for seamless drop-in replacement of Claude
    - Open Responses API - Native support for stateful agents with tool calling, streaming, background mode, and multi-turn conversations
    - Video & Image Generation Suite - New video gen UI with LTX-2 support for text-to-video and image-to-video
    - Unified GPU Backends - GPU libraries (CUDA, ROCm, Vulkan) packaged inside backend containers, works out of the box on Nvidia, AMD, and ARM64
    - Tool Streaming & XML Parsing - Full support for streaming tool calls and XML-formatted tool outputs
    - System-Aware Backend Gallery - Only see backends your system can run (e.g., hide MLX on Linux)
    - Moonshine Backend - Ultra-fast transcription engine for low-end devices
    - Pocket-TTS - Lightweight, high-fidelity text-to-speech with voice cloning
    - Vulkan arm64 builds - Backends and images now available for Vulkan on arm64


  Additional fixes and improvements:
    - Prevents crashes on AVX-only CPUs (Intel Sandy/Ivy Bridge) that lack BMI2 instructions
    - Fixed swapped VRAM usage reporting on AMD GPUs
    - Request tracing for debugging agents and fine-tuning
    - New 'reasoning' field to extract thinking steps from model output
    - Fixed authentication requirement for health check endpoints
    - UI improvements including fixed navbar ordering and consistent button styling
