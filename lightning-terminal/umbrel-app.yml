tagline: The easiest way to manage channel liquidity
description: >-
  Lightning Terminal is the easiest way to manage inbound and
  outbound liquidity on the Lightning Network. Keep your channels open and the
  funds flowing. It provides a visual interface for interacting with your
  channels and balances using Loop.


  🚨 CRITICAL REMINDER FOR TAPROOT ASSETS USERS:

  Uninstalling this app permanently erases application data, which includes Taproot Assets and Bitcoin funds.
  Before uninstalling or re-installing this app, you must backup the application's .tapd data folder in order to restore your taproot assets upon reinstallation.
  Failure to do so will result in permanent loss of funds. We recommend that you make regular backups.
  Follow this guide to backup your tapd data:

  Why use Pool?

  - Earn a return on Lightning capital

  - Rent a channel and start accepting payments instantly

  - Open channels for less with transaction batching


  Why use Loop?

  - Add "inbound liquidity" to receive payments

  - Reduce transaction fees by recycling and reusing Lightning channels

  - Send funds to and from users or services that aren't yet Lightning enabled

  - Configurable wait times and "batching" allow for further fee savings

  - Refill and offload funds from any number of Lightning channels in a single on-chain transaction

releaseNotes: >-
  This release of Lightning Terminal (LiT) includes updates to the versions
  of the integrated LND, Loop and Taproot Assets daemons.


  IMPORTANT NOTE: To avoid loss of funds, it's imperative that you read the
  Operational Safety Guidelines
  (https://github.com/lightninglabs/taproot-assets/blob/main/docs/safety.md)
  before using tapd on mainnet!

  The Taproot Assets daemon is still in alpha state, which means there can
  still be bugs and not all desired data safety and backup mechanisms have been
  implemented yet. Releasing on mainnet mainly signals that there will be no
  breaking changes in the future and that assets minted with v0.3.0 will be
  compatible with later versions.


  We'll be continuously working to improve the user experience based on
  feedback from the community.


  This release packages LND v0.17.3-beta, Taproot Assets Daemon v0.3.2-alpha,
  Loop v0.26.6-beta, Pool v0.6.4-beta and Faraday v0.2.11-alpha.
