  Lightning Terminal is the easiest way to manage inbound and
  outbound liquidity on the Lightning Network. Keep your channels open and the
  funds flowing. It provides a visual interface for interacting with your
  channels and balances using Loop. 


  New: Introducing Lightning Pool, a marketplace for Lightning channels. You can now earn sats by opening new channels to those looking to receive funds on Lightning for a set period of time, or rent a channel to start accepting payments instantly. Join the marketplace and start putting your Bitcoin to work.


  Why use Pool?

  - Earn a return on Lightning capital

  - Rent a channel and start accepting payments instantly

  - Open channels for less with transaction batching


  Why use Loop?

  - Add "inbound liquidity" to receive payments

  - Reduce transaction fees by recycling and reusing Lightning channels

  - Send funds to and from users or services that aren't yet Lightning enabled

  - Configurable wait times and "batching" allow for further fee savings

  - Refill and offload funds from any number of Lightning channels in a single on-chain transaction

releaseNotes: >-
  This release of Lightning Terminal (LiT) includes updates to the versions
  of the integrated LND, Pool, Loop and Faraday daemons. A few updates to LiT
  itself have also been included: LiT can now be started with the `--disableui`
  option meaning that the local UI will not be accessible and the `uipassword`
  would no longer need to be set. REST annotations are also added for all LiT 
  services.
  
  We'll be continuously working to improve the user experience based on 
  feedback from the community.
  
  This release packages LND v0.16.0-beta, Loop v0.22.0-beta, Pool v0.6.2-beta, 
  and Faraday v0.2.10-alpha.
