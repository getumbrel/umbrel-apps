  channels and balances using Loop. 


  New: Introducing Lightning Pool, a marketplace for Lightning channels.

  - Rent a channel and start accepting payments instantly

  - Open channels for less with transaction batching


  Why use Loop?

  - Add "inbound liquidity" to receive payments

  - Reduce transaction fees by recycling and reusing Lightning channels

  - Send funds to and from users or services that aren't yet Lightning enabled

  - Configurable wait times and "batching" allow for further fee savings

  - Refill and offload funds from any number of Lightning channels in a single on-chain transaction

releaseNotes: >-
  This release of Lightning Terminal (LiT) includes a variety of updates
  including support for off-chain accounts and the ability to customize the 
  permissions of an LNC session through the UI. It also contains an 
  implementation of a rule firewall and a privacy firewall. The rule 
  firewall can be used to verify the parameters of certain calls (for example 
  ensuring that calls only act on a specific set of channels) and the privacy 
  firewall can be used to force private info (such as pub keys, channel IDs etc) 
  to be mapped out to random values for responses and mapped back to real values
  for requests. An Autopilot client is added which handles registration of LNC 
  sessions with the Autopilot server. Autopilot calls will be forced to go 
  through the new rule and privacy firewalls.


  We'll be continuously working to improve the user experience based on feedback
  from the community.


  This release packages LND v0.15.5-beta, Loop v0.21.0-beta, Pool v0.6.1-beta, 
  and Faraday v0.2.9-alpha.
