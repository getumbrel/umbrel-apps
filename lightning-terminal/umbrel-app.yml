releaseNotes: >-
  This release of Lightning Terminal (LiT) updates the integrated LND daemon
  version to the latest v0.17.0-beta release, as well as updates the
  integrated Loop daemon to the latest patch release.

  In this release of LiT, a new Status server was added, which enables users
  to disable the different integrated sub-servers and the integrated accounts
  sub-system in LiT through configuration. LiT will now also successfully
  start even if any of the sub-servers or sub-systems fails to start.

  This release of LiT also enables the ability to link a new Autopilot
  session with an old session, as well as enabling the ability to specify
  feature configurations for an Autopilot session.

  One important change to note for users running LiT through docker, is that
  due to the new status server feature, the startup process of LiT will not
  error and end if a sub-server or sub-system fails to start. So any
  platforms that rely on docker to automatically restart the LiT container
  if the startup process ends due to the sub-servers or sub-system not having
  started yet, will now not restart the container as the start process won't
  exit.
  

  We'll be continuously working to improve the user experience based on
  feedback from the community. 
  
  
  This release packages LND v0.17.0-beta, Taproot Assets Daemon v0.2.3-alpha,
  Loop v0.26.3-beta, Pool v0.6.4-beta and Faraday v0.2.11-alpha.
