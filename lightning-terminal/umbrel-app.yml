releaseNotes: >-
  This release of Lightning Terminal (LiT) includes an update to the integrated
  Taproot Assets daemon version. This release also adds functionality to query
  information of specific LND accounts, as well as enabling labeling of
  accounts.

  There was no v0.10.3-alpha release, due to a build issue we had to skip that
  version and go directly to v0.10.4-alpha.
  
  
  We'll be continuously working to improve the user experience based on
  feedback from the community.
  
  
  This release packages LND v0.16.4-beta, Taproot Assets Daemon v0.2.3-alpha,
  Loop v0.25.2-beta, Pool v0.6.4-beta and Faraday v0.2.11-alpha.
