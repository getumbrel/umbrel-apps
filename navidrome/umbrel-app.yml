releaseNotes: >-
  Navidrome v0.58.0 introduces Multi-library Support, a major enhancement that allows you to organize and manage multiple music collections with proper permission controls and complete user interface integration. This feature enables creating separate libraries for different music collections (e.g., personal music, family music, audiobooks) while maintaining proper access controls and data isolation.


  ⚠️ Important:


  Full Scan Recommended:
    Although this release does not force a full scan on upgrade, it is highly recommended to perform one as soon as possible. This is because the multi-library changes can affect how moved, renamed, or retagged files are detected, potentially leading to a loss of annotations (such as stars, playcounts, or playlist references). During the full scan, you might see duplicate albums temporarily, which is expected, as duplicates will be removed at the end of the process.


  Database Migration Warning:
    This release includes database schema changes that are NOT reversible by simply downgrading to a previous version of Navidrome.


    Before installing this version:
      - BACKUP YOUR DATABASE: Create a complete backup of your navidrome.db file.
      - TEST ON A COPY FIRST: If possible, test this version on a copy of your data before upgrading your main installation.


    If you need to rollback:
      - Stop Navidrome.
      - Restore your database backup.
      - Reinstall the previous version.


  Highlights include:
    - Multi-library Support: Create and manage multiple music libraries with separate music folders, library-aware permissions, and a new admin interface for management.
    - UI Improvements: Added Hindi language translation, enhanced activity panel, and general translation updates.
    - Plugin Enhancements: Improved plugin capabilities and added plugin insights.
    - Various fixes for the user interface, scanner, and Subsonic API.
