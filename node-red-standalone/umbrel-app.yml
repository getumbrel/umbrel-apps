description: >-
  Node-RED is a visual programming tool for wiring together hardware
  devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.


  It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click. A built-in library allows you to save useful functions, templates or flows for re-use.


  The flows created in Node-RED are stored using JSON which can be easily imported and exported for sharing with others. An online flow library allows you to share your best flows with the world.
