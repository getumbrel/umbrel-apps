description: >-
  Start a secure tunnel to access your Umbrel apps from the Internet using Cloudflare network. 
  With Tunnel, you do not send traffic to an external IP — instead, 
  this app containing a lightweight tunneluing daemon (cloudflared) creates outbound-only 
  connections to Cloudflare's global network.


  To use this app, you must have a set up Cloudflare account with added domains. 
  Once you've done setting it up, check out the guide with examples to configure your own tunnel:
  https://github.com/Radiokot/umbrel-cloudflared/wiki/How-to-set-up-Cloudflare-Tunnel-on-your-Umbrel


  ⚠️ Apps accessible from the Internet incentivize attackers and bots to hack into them. 
  Only expose harmless apps or those having strong internal access control.
