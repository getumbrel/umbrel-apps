  Take control of your digital sovereignty by choosing Bitcoin Knots to run your node! By using Knots, youâ€™re supporting a version of Bitcoin that prioritizes efficiency, security, and flexibility. With Bitcoin Knotsâ€™ enhanced configuration options, you can fine-tune your node to help keep the network clean and resilient, actively reducing unnecessary load from spam or parasitic transactions.


  Every node strengthens the Bitcoin network, and your decision to use Bitcoin Knots contributes directly to a more decentralized and spam-resistant ecosystem. Your node not only validates and secures transactions but also sets an example for a more sustainable, user-focused Bitcoin network.


  Welcome to the community of Bitcoin Knots users, and thank you for helping Bitcoin grow stronger!


  Here's a guide on how to move the blockchain from bitcoin core to knots: https://docs.mempool.guide/page/migrationumbrel.html


  To forward incoming peer traffic to your device, set up the following configuration: (router) 8333 -> (device) 9333

releaseNotes: >-
  ðŸš¨ After updating to this new version, please restart any connected apps (e.g., DATUM, Lightning Node, etc) to ensure they re-connect properly.
  Also, if you have forwarded ports on your router for incoming peer connections, you will need to make sure you are forwarding 9333 on your router to 9333 on your device.


  This update introduces a completely redesigned experience, rebuilt from the ground up, both architecturally and visually, to give you a powerful, data-rich view into every aspect of your node's operation.
  
  
  From visualizing the network in real time to fine-tuning your configuration, the tools you need for ultimate sovereignty are now at your fingertips.
  
  
  ### New features:
  
  - **Globe**: A stunning, real-time visualization of your node's global connections. See new peers connect and transactions broadcast around the world, as it happens.
  
  - **Blocks**: Follow along as each new block arrives, packed with transactions, and is verified by your own node.

  - **Insights**: Key metrics about your node and the network are now presented in a series of clean, elegant charts.

  - **Peers**: A completely new table gives you a detailed, sortable list of every peer your node is connected to.

  - **Settings**: Fine-tune your node with a simplified, searcheable, and more intuitive layout for the settings. 

  - **Configuration Editor**: Power users can now make custom fine-grained adjustments to their `bitcoin.conf` file directly from a new editor in the app's settings.


  A new chapter for self-sovereignty begins.
