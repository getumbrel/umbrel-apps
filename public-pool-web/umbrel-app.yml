tagline: Modern web interface for managing your Public Pool's data
description: >
  Public Pool's Web provides a sleek, user-friendly interface for managing and monitoring
  your Public Pool's data. 


  Built with Rails 8.0 and modern web technologies, it offers
  real-time updates, detailed analytics, and comprehensive pool management features.


  Features:
    - Add user
    - Add worker
    - Change theme
    - Sidekiq web interface ( to check background jobs, usually you do not mess with it )


  ⚠️ Notes:
    - Change host IP ( and port is needed ) of your pool. ( Public Pool doesn't expose its IP yet ) 
    - If you change host IP and port of the pool, restart the application in umbrel OS. Otherwise, sidekiq will not see them.


  This is a hobby project!
