tagline: Block ads on your entire network
description: >-
  Instead of browser plugins or other software on each computer,
  install Pi-hole® on your Umbrel and your entire network is protected.
  Network-level blocking allows you to block ads in non-traditional places such
  as mobile apps and smart TVs, regardless of hardware or OS. Since
  advertisements are blocked before they are downloaded, network performance is
  improved and will feel faster. 


  In addition to blocking advertisements, Pi-hole® has an informative Web interface that shows stats on all the domains being queried on your network. Pi-hole® works fine with an existing DHCP server, but you can use Pi-hole®'s to keep your network management in one place.

releaseNotes: >-
  ⚠️ If you have set up your router to use Pi-hole as its only DNS server, umbrelOS may be unable to resolve domain names during the update, preventing it from downloading the update files.
  To avoid issues, temporarily set a backup DNS server (e.g., 1.1.1.1) on your router before updating— or configure a permanent fallback DNS to prevent future issues.


  This release includes several improvements and bug fixes:
    - Improved compatibility with older versions of Docker
    - Added bash-completion package
    - Updated gravity update schedule
    - Enhanced DNS and NTP functionality
    - Ensured pi.hole domain remains local and improved API and system info reporting  
    - Updated security and performance in API, web, and core components  
    - Enhanced UI with better HTTPS detection, query logging, and layout fixes  
    - Added support for 2FA handling and better logging in the core system  
    - Various bug fixes, optimizations, and UI improvements
