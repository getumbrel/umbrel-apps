tagline: Block ads on your entire network
description: >-
  Instead of browser plugins or other software on each computer,
  install Pi-holeÂ® on your Umbrel and your entire network is protected.
  Network-level blocking allows you to block ads in non-traditional places such
  as mobile apps and smart TVs, regardless of hardware or OS. Since
  advertisements are blocked before they are downloaded, network performance is
  improved and will feel faster. 


  In addition to blocking advertisements, Pi-holeÂ® has an informative Web interface that shows stats on all the domains being queried on your network. Pi-holeÂ® works fine with an existing DHCP server, but you can use Pi-holeÂ®'s to keep your network management in one place.
