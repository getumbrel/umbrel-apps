  Outline is a modern, fast, and collaborative knowledge base for growing teams. It combines the best of wikis, documents, and tasks into one beautiful interface that your team will actually want to use.


  Outline helps teams organize their knowledge and collaborate on documents in real-time. With a clean, intuitive interface inspired by tools like Notion, it makes it easy to create, edit, and share documentation. Whether you're building a company wiki, documenting processes, or managing project notes, Outline provides a powerful yet simple solution.


  Key features include real-time collaborative editing, a beautiful markdown-based editor, powerful search across all your documents, and flexible organization with nested documents and collections. The platform supports rich media embedding, code syntax highlighting, and integrates seamlessly with your existing workflow.


  Outline is designed with privacy and security in mind. All data is stored locally on your server, giving you complete control over your team's knowledge base. The platform includes granular permissions, allowing you to control who can view, edit, or share specific documents and collections.


  This Umbrel installation includes Dex as a lightweight OIDC authentication provider, making it easy to get started without complex authentication setup.


  Perfect for teams of any size, from small startups to large organizations, Outline scales with your needs while maintaining speed and simplicity.
