description: >-
  Run your Bitcoin node and independently store and validate
  every single Bitcoin transaction with it. Achieve unparalleled
  privacy by connecting your wallet directly to your node to
  ensure that your wallet company can’t spy on your transactions,
  or worse — lie to you.


  Plus, transacting with your own node also helps keep the entire
  Bitcoin network decentralized; win-win!


  Don't trust. Verify. On steroids.
