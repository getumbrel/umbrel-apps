description: >-
  Run your Bitcoin node and independently store and validate
  every single Bitcoin transaction with it. Achieve unparalleled
  privacy by connecting your wallet directly to your node to
  ensure that your wallet company can’t spy on your transactions,
  or worse — lie to you.


  Plus, transacting with your own node also helps keep the entire
  Bitcoin network decentralized; win-win!


  Don't trust. Verify. On steroids.

releaseNotes: >-
  Advanced settings are here!


  - Toggle Tor, Clearnet, and I2P for outgoing connections, and enable Mempool Full RBF.


  - Enable incoming connections to run a listening node and help others sync their node.


  - Switch networks between mainnet, testnet, regtest, and signet.


  - Setting up a new node? Speed up your initial sync by increasing the cache size.


  - Finally, you can run a pruned node, which allows you to delete old blocks that are not relevant to you to save on storage space.


  Note: This update fixes a bug with pruning in the previous 24.0.1 update.
