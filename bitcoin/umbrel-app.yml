tagline: Run your personal node powered by Bitcoin Core
description: >-
  Run your Bitcoin node, powered by Bitcoin Core. Independently store and validate every Bitcoin transaction.
  Connect your wallet directly to your node for unmatched privacy so your wallet provider can't track your activity - or worse, mislead you.


  Transacting through your own node also helps keep the Bitcoin network decentralized â€” win-win.


  With over 20 advanced settings, you're in full control. Choose which version of Bitcoin Core your node runs, 
  how your node connects to other nodes over Tor, clearnet, and I2P, adjust daily upload limits, set the maximum mempool size, 
  fine-tune performance, and much more.


  Don't trust. Verify. On steroids.
