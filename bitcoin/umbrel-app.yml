tagline: Run your personal node powered by Bitcoin Core
description: >-
  Run your Bitcoin node and independently store and validate
  every single Bitcoin transaction with it. Achieve unparalleled
  privacy by connecting your wallet directly to your node to
  ensure that your wallet company can’t spy on your transactions,
  or worse — lie to you.


  Plus, transacting with your own node also helps keep the entire
  Bitcoin network decentralized; win-win!


  With over 20 advanced settings, you can take control of your node
  and customize it to your needs. Control how your node connects to
  other nodes over Tor, clearnet, and I2P, adjust your daily upload
  limit, set the maximum mempool size, fine-tune its performance,
  and much more.


  Don't trust. Verify. On steroids.

releaseNotes: >-
  This release of the Bitcoin Node app includes the following updates:


  - Bitcoin Core: Upgrades Bitcoin Core to version 27.0. Full release notes for Bitcoin Core 27.0 can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-27.0.md.


  - New Advanced Settings Options: Adds 3 new options to the Advanced Settings menu:
    - datacarrier: Choose whether or not to relay transactions with OP_RETURN outputs.
    - datacarriersize: Set the maximum size of the data in OP_RETURN outputs (in bytes) that your node will relay.
    - permitbaremultisig: Choose wether or not to relay non-P2SH multisig transactions.


  - JoinMarket Compatibility: The deprecated RPC 'deprecatedrpc=create_bdb' is enabled to allow integration with JoinMarket and the Jam app by default.
  This fixes an issue where Jam app users who upgraded to Bitcoin Core v26.0 would have to manually add 'deprecatedrpc=create_bdb' to their bitcoin.conf file in order for the app to work.
  
  
  ⚠️ For existing Jam users, if you receive a connection error in Jam after updating to Bitcoin Core v27.0, please restart the Jam app from your homescreen by right-clicking on the app and selecting 'restart'.
