3. Locate and download the `exports.sh` file to your computer
4. Open the file in a text editor and update the following line with your Umbrel's IP address:

```bash
# Replace with your Umbrel's IP or host name
export UMBREL_HOST="172.17.0.3" # your's might be different
```

5. Save the file and upload it back to the same location
