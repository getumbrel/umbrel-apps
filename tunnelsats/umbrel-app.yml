description: >-
  Tunnelsats integrates with your LND and Core Lightning apps to provide anonymous, hybrid routing over the fast WireGuard protocol.

  By utilizing Tunnelsats, your Lightning node will route all of its clearnet traffic through our global, privacy-preserving VPN servers to prevent your home IP address from being exposed or targeted.
releaseNotes: >-
  Rebuilt from the ground up to support the new umbrelOS immutable architecture.
  Now runs seamlessly as an app, automatically intercepting traffic for Core Lightning and LND while maintaining a strict killswitch protocol.
