  🦞 Homarr is a modern self-hosted dashboard designed to help users manage and organize their web applications and services in one central place. It acts as a personalized homepage accessible through a web browser, allowing individuals to have quick and easy access to all their important links, servers, containers, and APIs. This makes it especially useful for people who run multiple services on their own servers or devices and want a clean, unified interface to interact with them.


  The main purpose of Homarr is to provide an intuitive and visually appealing overview of various self-hosted services. Users can create customizable cards or tiles representing different applications or endpoints. These tiles can be arranged to suit personal preferences, making it simple to find and launch the desired service without having to remember multiple URLs or manage numerous bookmarks. The dashboard offers flexibility in design, allowing adjustments in layout, colors, and icons to match the user's style or to improve usability.


  Because Homarr is self-hosted, it gives users full control over their data and environment. It can be deployed on devices such as home servers, network-attached storage systems, or virtual private servers. Security features can be enabled to restrict access to authorized users only, which ensures that the dashboard and the linked services remain protected from unauthorized use.


  Homarr is particularly appealing to tech enthusiasts, system administrators, and anyone who manages a complex setup of self-hosted applications. It reduces the hassle of navigating through different interfaces and provides a streamlined experience for monitoring and accessing services. By consolidating everything into a single, easy-to-use interface, Homarr improves productivity and organization.


  In summary, Homarr is a customizable and secure dashboard solution for individuals looking to centralize access to their self-hosted web applications. It enhances convenience by offering a visually structured and personalized entry point to a variety of online services and tools.
