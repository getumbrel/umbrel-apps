  **Your thoughts are yours.**

  Obsidian stores notes on your device, so you can access them quickly, even offline. No one else can read them, not even us.


  **Your mind is unique.**

  With thousands of plugins and themes, you can shape Obsidian to fit your way of thinking.


  **Your knowledge should last.**

  Obsidian uses open, non-proprietary files, so you're never locked in, and can preserve your data for the long term.
