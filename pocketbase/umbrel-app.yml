  ⏱️ Realtime database

  Embedded performant database with schema builder, data validations, realtime subscriptions and easy to use REST api.


  🪪 Authentication

  Manage your app users and handle email/password and OAuth2 sign ups (Google, Facebook, GitHub, GitLab) without the hassle.


  💾 File storage

  Sanely store files locally or in a S3 storage. Easily attach media to your database records and generate thumbs on the fly.


  🧩 Extendable

  Use as a standalone app OR as a framework, that you can extend via Go and JavaScript hooks to create your own custom portable backend.
