  Pingvin Share is self-hosted file sharing platform and an alternative for WeTransfer.


  🛠️ To use Pingvin Share as intended you may need to expose it to the public internet. The easiest way to do this is to download the 'Cloudflare Tunnel' app from the umbrel app store, and expose Pingvin Share (running on port 6453) using your own domain.
